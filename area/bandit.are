red dragon balefire~
Balefire~
A young red dragon swings quickly towards you as you enter.
~
Young among his kind, Balefire is nonetheless a powerful creature in his
own right.  His bright crimson scales have only recently begun to turn to a
darker shade, and his hide is still relatively soft and supple.  He glares
at you as he slashes at you with razor sharp claws.

bandit anton~
Anton~
The bandit raiding leader looks at you with disdain.
~
A large imposing figure looms before you.  His helm covers most of his
face, and is carved in the likeness of a curled dragon, wings outspread. 
His cloak almost conceals his armor, allowing him to blend into the shadows.
Steely gray eyes glare at you from beneath his visor, laden with animosity
and contempt.

The Dark Forest~
~
~
Ahead of you stretches a dark expanse of forest.  Large and ancient trees
grow over the path in front of you, allowing only a few rays of light to
illuminate the forest floor.  The smells and sounds of the ancient forest
beckon to you and warn you at the same time of the mysteries contained deep
in its leafy canopy.

Path in the Dark Forest~
~

Precious few rays of sunlight pierce the thick ceiling of overhanging
trees and leaves above your head.  Through this gloom, a simple dirt path
stretches in front of you, covered by a thick carpet of moldering leaves on
all sides.  As you go further on the path, the darkness becomes heavier and
the air presses on your from all sides.

The shadows have formed an impenetrable wall of darkness around you. 
From deep within the forest you hear the rustling of leaves as one of the
wood's denizens shuffles across the leafy floor.  The slightest snap of a
twig sets you on edge as you begin to imagine horrible creatures eyeing your
from the shadows.  To make things worse, you are posed with a choice of as
the path splits here.

Path in the Dark Forest~

Stumbling and swearing, you continue along the dark path.  The thick
canopy above your head completely blocks all sunlight, plunging you into
darkness.  The air here seems moist and thick, making it difficult to
breathe.  The carpet of leaves here is thick and soft, and you can't see any
sign of the dirt beneath.  The path splits to the west, east, and south.

Wreckage~
~
~
Scattered across the clearing before you are many burned and wrecked
merchant wagons.  Once the purveryors of rich goods for the merchants of the
surrounding lands, the wagons now lie in ruined silence.  Upon closer
inspection, you make out some human bones sticking out of the spaces between
some of the burned hulks.  Ironically, the rest of the clearing is the very
model of sylvan beauty.  Great trees spread their leafy branches over your
head, serving as the home to numerous singing birds.  The grass beneath your
feet is green and soft, but much of it has been burnt towards the center of
the clearing.  The only exit is the path to the west.

You are deep within the darkest recesses of the forest.  The trees here
are truly enormous, the only thing able to grow beneath their stifling
canopy is a green moss covering their trunks and the ground.  Dead leaves
form a thick carpet beneath your feet, muffling the sounds of your passing
and softening your step.  The path stretches before you to the east and

Along the Base of a Cliff~

Spreading like a vast impenetrable wall to the south, an ancient and dark

a stark contrast against the cold stone.  The only obvious exit is to the

Hidden Cave~
~

Hollowed out by the passage of wind and underground water, this natural
cave extends deep into the cliff face.  The sounds of dripping water echoes
from afar and the air is damp and heavy.  From even farther in the tunnels,
you hear a dull roaring sound, faint and elusive.  The cave extends further
north into the earth, while the entrance to the cave is to the south.

Grim Warning~

~
Bile rises in your throat as you enter this room to behold the macabre
scene in front of you.  Splayed across the walls, tied by ropes to iron
spikes in the wall, are the remains of some poor humanoids, their race no
longer discernable.  Dark rusty patches stain the walls and floor, and the
faces of the corpses are frozen in the agony of their final moments.  To the
north, you hear the sound of wind whistling as if through some gigantic
tube.  Passages also lead to the east and south.

Crude Stables~

Some is using this small cave as a makeshift stable.  Wooden partitions
are haphazardly arranged around the cave and straw is strewn across the
ground.  The smell of manure is magnified by the lack of air movement,
making the room almost unbearable to be in.  A trough with food and water
stands against one wall, but the contents don't look like they've been
changed for ages.  The only exit is to the west.

cliff.  A brisk wind whistles through the shaft, creating an eerie wailing
sound and a small waterfall tumbles down the far wall.  The sides of the
shaft are smooth, but simple rope ladders allow you to go up or down.  In
addition, a passage leads to the south.

simple rope ladder allows you to go downwards, and paths lead to the north,

crystals along the walls.  Bending the light from the few torches in the
wall, the crystals create a rainbow of colors across the tunnel.  The water
that once ran through this tunnel has long since been diverted and dust
floats in the air, catching beams of light.  To the west you see a large
chamber and the crystal tunnel continues to the east.

large chunks.  Where and why the people took the crystals is unknown.

a small pool on the cave floor, filling the room with the soft murmur of
water.  Delicate crystal formations along the walls glitter and sparkle,
making the cave look as if encrusted by radiant gemstones.  A makeshift
wooden stairway leads to a ledge high above the cave floor, and tunnels lead

simple ringed pit in the center of the room, providing the room's only light
and revealing crude drawings scribbled on the walls.  Around the fire pit, a
collection of bones and torn pieces of cloth have been discarded.  The only

At the Bottom of the Murky Waterfall~
~
~
You find yourself in a damp, sticky cavern with walls that glisten with
moisture.  A large dirty waterfall spills over a ledge far above and empties
into a pool of water that resembles an enormous mud puddle.  Beyond the
sound of the roaring waterfall and the dripping of water, the cavern is
silent and your footsteps echo harshly in your ear.  A small shadowy tunnel
leads to the west and a rope slick with moss allows you to go up.

A Dark Passage~
~
~
As you travel through this dark and shadowy passage, you can almost feel
the weight of the blackness around you pressing on your skin.  The sounds of
a sizeable waterfall can be heard down the passage to the east The walls
here are rough and appear to have been hewn from the rock rather than formed
by the natural passage of water.  The passage leads to the north and to the
east.

A Dark Passage~
~
~
The passage here practically shakes as the noise of a large waterfall to
the north assails your ears.  The load crash of water almost deafens you. 
Coupled with the darkness, you find the dull rumbling din disorienting and
you almost drop your light in an effort to protect your ears.  The dark
passage goes north towards a large cavern and also continues south.

Base of the Black Waterfall~
~
~
You find yourself in an enormous cavern whose ceiling is lost in the
gloom above you.  An enormous waterfall empties into a small lake of water
at the north end of the room, creating a sound that is almost unbearable. 
Your ears begin to pound with the sheer force of sound and your face is
delicately sprayed with a watery mist.  You wipe the water from your face
and realize that the water is amazingly warm, almost the water temperature
of the ocean shallows on a hot day.  You look closer at the waterfall and
notice that the water seems to be black!  A primitive rope ladder leads up
the side of the waterfall into the darkness above you.  A small roughly hewn
passage leads to the south.

Midway up the Black Waterfall~
~

From this point on the rope ladder, you feel as if you are floating in an
impenetrable see of darkness.  A large waterfall, it's water black with some
foreign substance, cascades to the floor below, creating a terribly loud
roar as it plunges to the depths.  The wall by the ladder is wet and sticky,
and the rock is smoothed and rounded from the action of the water.  The only
ways from here are up and down.

forest below you.  Somewhere to the south, you see what looks like some old
stone ruins rising from a clearing.  Suddenly, a wind gust tears your eyes
away from the forest and back to the cliff face before you, as you struggle
to keep from falling.  You manage to make out the outlines of a ledge above
you.

You find yourself on a ledge high above a beautiful crystalline cave. 
Large crystal formations protrude from the walls and the ceiling, refracting
the light of torches to create shimmering patterns and rainbows.  A small
waterfall tumbles to the cave floor, creating a soft and soothing sounds as
it splashes into a small pool below.  You are transfixed with the scene
spread below you, mesmerized by the twinkling of light and the natural
beauty of this place.  A small makeshift wooden stairway leads down to the
cave floor and a tunnel winds its way to the north

of a large cavern below.  A walkway has been created and formed by some
unknown craftsman around the ledge of the pit, down into which the water
plunges.  The water itself is black , and it only takes a look at the walls
in this cavern to discern why.  Ash and soot forms a thick layer over the
walls and floors, staining the water as it flows past.  A large gate of some
sort lies to the east while passages lead south and west.

End of Old Tunnel~
~
~
You have reached the end of the dimly lit passage that serves as the
dungeon of the bandits.  The smell of sweat and waste is almost
overpowering, emnating from the door to the west.  The torches
on the walls only barely provide enough light to see by, and your footing is
precarious on the smooth and wet stones beneath you.  The passage continues
to the south.

The Pit~
~
~
The room you have entered is rather small, lit by a few flickering
torches set in the walls.  The smell of unwashed bodies and excrement waft
up from a dark looking pit in the center of the room, the only feature of
this cave.  A coil of rope sits at the edge of the pit, secured to a metal
ring set in the stone wall.  You can either descend into the dark pit or
leave through the arch to the west.

Guard Room~
~
~
The room you have entered is furnished only with a simple wooden table
and a few old chairs.  An old oil burning lamp is the room's only source of
light, making it hard to judge the exact dimensions of the chamber.  A few
old and crude weapons lean against the walls.  The table shows the signs of
wittling, probably the work of bored guards.  The only exit is the archway
to the east.

Damp Cell~
~
~
An overpowering stench assails your senses as you enter the dim cell. 
Moisture sticks to your skin, making you feel slimy and unclean.  Someone
has thrown some straw on the floor, but you can still hear your feet slosh
through some slimy liquid beneath you.  Rusty chains and some blood stains
are all that adorn the walls and the only light is provided by the window in
the door to the east.

Damp Cell~
~
~
The smell from the passage is almost overwhelming in this damp little
cubicle.  The smell of rotting straw mingles with the smell of humanoid
waste, burning your nostrils and sending you reeling.  Dim light filters
through the door to the west, providing the only illumination in this room. 
It looks as if some old rusty chains were once fastened to the walls but
have been broken off by some powerful creature.

Damp Cell~
~
~
The cell that you have entered is unlit, the only illumination provided
by a small window in the door to the east.  Rotting straw has been strewn on
the floor, but it does nothing to make this smelly and damp prison liveable.
The stench almost overpowers you, and your stomach turns as you notice the
slimy liquid that lies beneath your feet.  Old rusty chains have been driven
into the walls to detain the prisoners, and you also notice some old blood
stains on the walls.

Above Smelly Pit~
~
~
Your nostrils burn as an unbelievable stench rises from the pit in the
center of this cave.  Pieces of garbage are strewn around its edges, and
strange liquids stain the stones.  Messy bones, broken pots, and banana
peels lie beneath your feet.  The only exits are down into the pit and to
the north.

Garbage Pit~
~
~
Your eyes water as you find yourself knee deep in garbage and refuse. 
Bones, skulls, bottles, papers, wood, and all other manner of garbage has
been dumped here by the inhabitants of these caves.  In addition, the stench
gives you the feeling that they also use this as their cess pit.  A rotting
hemp rope leads out of the pit.

Beside a Large Stream~
~
~
Cutting through the mountain over the centuries, a large stream rushes
past you and flows down the tunnel to the east.  A simple walkway has been
hewn on the side of the river, allowing you to safely travel through here. 
The walls appear to have been shaped by the hands of craftsmen to enhance
the beauty and curve of the stones.  A dull roaring sound tells you that the
stream hurtles toward a waterfall to the east.

Large Cavern~
~
~
This cavern appears to have been a large entry hall of some kind.  A pile
of rubble to the north blocks any further passage north, however.  The
stream seems to run from under the rocks down the passage to the south. 
Large angular dwarven runes are carved into the walls, and a large symbol of
a hammer laid over and anvil is emblazoned above the blocked passage.  The
only apparent exit is to the south.

Base of the Wide Shaft~
~
~
A large open shaft pushes its way up through the rock, and a faint breeze
leads you to believe that there is an open exit somewhere above you.  The
shaft seems to have been dug out of the rock, smoothed by tremendous heat. 
The shaft and the tunnel to the west must be at least thirty feet in
diameter.  Upon close inspection, you notice that the roughly hewn rock
affords you some decent handholds for a climb upwards.

Top of the Wide Shaft~
~

You stand on the lip of a wide shaft that leads down into the depths of
the rock.  A cool breeze wafts in from an openning to the west, whistling
through this cave and streaming down the shaft.  You can feel that the air
in the shaft is noticeably warmer than the rest of the cavern.  A very
sturdy metal door inscribed with glowing runes lies to the north.

Secret Hoard~
~
~
This large room is filled with the ill-gotten loot of the young dragon
Balefire.  Works of art, suits of armor, piles of coins, and various other
items of value lie heaped around the room.  The walls are solid rock, carved
and smoothed to an almost mirror-like shine in which you can swear you see
your reflection.  To your south, a stout metal door is the only exit from
this room.

High Windy Ledge~
~
~
You find yourself on a windy ledge high above the surrounding land.  From
here you are granted a commanding view for miles in almost every direction. 
Unfortuneately, the wind is very strong and threatens to throw you off the
ledge to the rocks below.  There is a noticeable lack of vegetation at this
altitude, and the air has a sharp cold bite to it.  However, you feel a warm
breeze coming from the large cave to the west.

Path in the Dark Forest~
~
~
The path bends here, leading to the east and to the south.  An eerie
disconcerting silence has settled upon this part of the forest, raising the
hair on your neck.  The great ancient trees around you form an almost solid
wall, but you swear you can see small flashes of movement out of the corner
of your eye.

Path in the Dark Forest~
~
~
You find yourself deep inside of the ancient forest.  Incredibly ancient
trees wider than a man is tall grow all around you, obscuring your vision
and blocking the sunlight.  The trail ventures deeper into the trail to the
north and to the west you see a large clearing with some type of ruins.

Old Abandoned Temple~
~
~
The ruined skeleton of a once beautiful church stands here, lonely and
forlorn.  In times gone by, this church saw droves of devout pilgrims
travelling through its wide doors.  Now, only birds and forest animals visit
it.  How long it has been standing here alone in this clearing is unknown to
you, but the stone remains are worn and etched by time.  The only obvious
exit is back into the forest to the east.

Bottom of the Pit~
~
~
You stand in the bandits' most dreaded of cells.  The floor is covered by
a shallow pool of water that exudes the smell of excrement and waste.  The
walls are sheer and almost totally smooth, moisture forming in large
droplets then running to the small pool at your feet.  Exit from the pit is
provided by an old rope that is lowered from above.  Small scratches have
been etched into the wall, probably by some previous denizen of this prison.

~

Pushing your way through the brush, you manage to uncover a trail.  The
surrounding forest grows darker every moment, causing you to wonder if the
path was covered for a reason.  All is silent as you face the entrance to a
dark and sinister looking forest.

The Kady Cat's Flat~
~
~
Comfort and cozy, this room is the private retreat of Kadyr.  A large
fire burns in the fireplace, sending cheery shadows dancing on the walls
amid a sea of reds and oranges.  A large desk sits in the far corner,
covered with papers and plans for some wacky area or another.  A large
comfortable couch with argyle plaid sits against another wall, a flannel
blanket carelessly tossed over it.  In front of the fireplace, a large thick
rug invites you to sit down and take the weight off of your feet and warm
your soul.  A large packed bookcase teems with books ranging from "The
Dragonbone Chair" to "Twelfth Night", all bound in soft leather and lovingly
arranged.  The final wall is dominated by a large window through which you
see a beautiful forest teeming with trees.  Small furry lemmings prance
around the tree trunks playfully.
