~
0 SHADOW BOLT~

With this spell, a vampire releases a bolt of negative energy, hurtling
it towards his opponent.  The damage from this shadow bolt is proportional
to the vampire's current level.
~
0 MARK~
Syntax: cast 'mark' <rune>

A powerful spellcaster is able to infuse a RUNE with energy that will give
it the ability to transport the one who unlocks it to a set location.  The
location of the RUNE will transport the user to is determined by the room

See also RUNE RECALL.
~
0 'RUNE RECALL'~

~
-1 MULTICLASSING REMORTALIZE~
Multiclassing is now functional.  Upon reaching level 100, the character
may opt to REMORTALIZE into a new class.  To do this, simply find the
Class Master, and use the REMORTALIZE command (explained below) to become
a multiclassed character.  When you succesfully use this command, you will
return to level 2, and will keep your old equipment.  You will not be
able to use any of it, unless it is equal to or below your level.  When
you log off, you will have this equipment when you return.  When advancing
in the new class, you will learn new skills and spells.  The skills of
your first class will automatically be practiced, and ready to use, when
you reach the appropriate level for that class.  Classes that use Blood
Points, originally, will continue to use blood points in the next class.
Classes that use mana originally, will continue to use mana in the next
class.  A multiclassed character earns only HALF the experience that a
non-multiclassed characte earns, but a single class character receives
a bonus practice each level.  This is very important to remember!

Syntax: remortalize <class>
Syntax: remortalize <class> pkiller
Syntax: remortalize <class> peaceful

Remortalize is the command used to become a new class.  It requires you
to have two million gold, and five hundred quest points.   The pkiller and
peaceful arguement require an additional 3 million gold and an additional
two hundred fifty quest points.  Remortalize is shown over the INFO
channel.  You must be in the presense of the class master for this to
work.
~
-1 SCHOOL~
Mud School was designed by Hatchet of MERC Industries for any MERC mud.

The purpose of Mud School is to orient new players to the basics of the
game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.

Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their
initial levels and equipment.

You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.

You may train your attributes and make them better at the Adept of Furey
one 'NORTH' and one 'WEST' of the Entrance of Mud School.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.

There is also a practice adept one 'NORTH' and one 'EAST' of the Entrance of
Mud School.  You may not practice until your character reaches 3rd level
however.  See 'HELP PRACTICE'.

~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
&RSyntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>&w

&BBUY&w buys an object from a shop keeper.

&BLIST&w with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
&BLIST&w <object> lists only the items corresponding with <object> the shop
keeper will sell you.

&BSELL&w sells an object to a shop keeper.

&BVALUE&w asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

&BBUY&w, &BSELL&w, and &BVALUE&w, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if &BLIST DAGGER&w showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:
"buy 3.dagger".
~
0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have AUTOEXIT set, you
will automatically see the visible exits whenever you walk into a room.
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt 
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type "drop all.pie".
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).

initiate combat.
~
0 DISARM~
Syntax: disarm

This skill will attempt to disarm your opponent if he is wielding a weapon.
~
0 SHRIEK~
Syntax:  shriek

VAMPIRES' powerful shriek shatters the air with the deadly wail of the 
living dead.  Only those within hand-to-hand combat with the vampire
will be affected.  Even a vampire without sight can raise his or her
voice to the intensity needed to cause incredible pain to those within
earshot.
~
0 CHOP~
Syntax: chop

An ASSASSIN may chop his opponent with blinding speed, causing considerable
shock damage to the nerves and tissue.  Repeated chops from the assassin
are know to cause death in some cases.
~
0 ACIDSHIELD~
Syntax: cast 'acidshield'

With this magical shield ANTI-PALADINS drench their bodies in acid.  The
acid is thick and protective, reducing physical damage done to the Anti-
Paladin.  This shield will retalliate to melee attacks with a powerful
blast of acid.

NOTE:  This spells is defensive in nature, and cannot be cast in combat.
The duration of the spells is proportional to the Anti-Paladins level.
Due to the restrictive nature of the magic known by Anti-Paladins, they
may not cast this spell on others.
~
0 KICK~
Syntax: kick

A KICK is exactly what it seems, a kick.  The user will attempt to kick his
or her opponent with their feet, causing moderate damage.
~
0 DIRT KICK~
Syntax: dirt

Dirt Kicking is a cheap skill known by assassins.  The secret of this
deadly skill is to hurl sand, dust, or mud into your opponent's eyes
by means of raising the foot swiftly.  Dirt kicking can also blind 
your enemy for a small amount of time.
~
0 KILL MURDER~
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.

murdering low level players, and there are penalties for using MURDER.

~
0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: read    <keyword>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
~
0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <target> <command>
Syntax: order all      <command>

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and
they will no longer follow your orders.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: wake  <character>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~

Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

    miss        wound           MUTILATE        DEVESTATE
    scratch     maul            DISEMBOWEL      OBLITERATE
    graze       decimate        EVISCERATE      ANNIHILATE
    hit         devastate       MASSACRE        EVISCERATE
    injure      maim            DEMOLISH        UNSPEAKABLE

It is rumored that there are higher forms of attack.
~
0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated in purgatory.  Your corpse is
taken by the Death Reaper and protected from scavengers.  You must find your
way through Purgatory to your corpse in order to reclaim your possessions.
Miraculously, however, your gold stays with you, so apparently you CAN take
it with you.

Any spells which were affecting you, good and bad, are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half-way back to
the beginning of your level.  Thus if you have a bad day and die several times,
the penalties won't clobber you.  This does not apply to those CHAMPION or
higher.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

CONFIG +GHOST

When you have this option turned on, you will become a ghost upon death.
You will not lose any experience this way, and you will not be transported
to the temple for healing.  You must be resurrected from a player with the
spell, or from an NPC healer via the HEAL command in order to do anything.
As a ghost, your commands are extremely limited.
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster
    being part of a group that completes a quest

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~
0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet.
~
0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug  <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~
0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.
~
0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <target>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, as well as
a comparison of your relative health.  Of course, it's only a rough estimate.

magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, than fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~
0 BASH 'BASH DOOR'~
Syntax: bash <direction>

A powerful warrior can attempt to bypass the intricacies of unlocking
and opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course,

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.

session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, may not be
saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of the MUD.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to
the Temple of.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'hp'|'mana'|'bp'|'move'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard atttributes based on your class, and several
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

You may also train your hitpoints, mana/blood points, and movement points.
Each of these costs one practice session and gives a somewhat unpredictable
gain.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
53 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~
52 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK NEWLOCK NUMLOCK~
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown
Syntax: wizlock
Syntax: numlock <number>
Syntax: newlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level immortal without a special bit set may not log in.  Players who
lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NUMLOCK shows at which character level and below may not log in.

NUMLOCK <number> sets which character level and below MAY NOT log in.
Players level immortal and above with a special bit set MAY log in.

all on an immortal (including yourself) or that person will immediately
lose all immortal abilities.

There is currently no way to enter more than one line of text for a
string-valued option.  In this case, MSET <character> description is
not supported.
~
53 NOEMOTE NOTELL SILENCE~
Syntax: noemote <character>
Syntax: notell  <character>

~
0 'POISON WEAPON'~
Syntax: poison <weapon>  
  
With this skill, a thief can create a deadly poison that can be poured
onto any weapon, rendering it more deadly.  This skill is not easy,
however, because the poison itself requires special ingredients, and the
thief must be steady of hand and clear of mind.  The profit-minded thief
(is there any other kind?) might even think about selling the products
of his or her labor to other adventurers for a tidy profit.
 
Be Warned!  The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon
in due time.  Special blades may be more resistant to the poison effects
on the steel.

extra attack.
~

   'HIGH EXPLOSIVE AMMO'~
Syntax: cast 'general purpose' <target>
Syntax: cast 'high explosive'  <target>

~
0 PRACTICIONER~
All PRACTITIONERS are fully versed in the skills of all classes, and
players can PRACTICE all of their available skills and spells in the
presence of a PRACTICIONER.
~
0 TRAINER~
TRAINERs can provide extensive training sessions which enable players
to TRAIN their base statistics.
~
-1 WAR WARRIOR~
The WARRIOR class is the most adept fighting class available.  Their
battle training along with their high strength make them one of the
most formidable opponents in hand to hand combat.  WARRIORs train in the
art of multiple attacks, and studying weapons.  High level warriors can
have many attacks, ENHANCED DAMAGE, WEAPONMASTER, and other such skills.
They do not receive much mana as they level, for they do not cast many
spells.
~
-1 CLE CLERIC~
The CLERIC, or priest, is a spellcasting class devoted primarily toward
defense.  The cleric practices spells in curing warding, protection and
healing.  Since the CLERIC is defensive in nature, they fare poorly
in the art of mortal combat.  They much prefer to be civil servants to
society or doctors to their comrades in arms.  Clerics can only cast
spells if they are not evil aligned.
~
-1 DARKPRIEST 'DARK PRIEST' DKP~
The DARK PRIEST is a spellcasting class devoted to the wills of evil.  The
demons of the mud give these powerful characters many offensive spells,
combined with vital defensive spells.  They prefer to pilliage the land
rather than help heal it, like their clerical counterparts.  Dark Priests
can only cast spells if they are not good aligned.
~
-1 MAG MAGE MAGIC MAGIC-USER 'MAGIC USER'~
The MAGE class is a spellcasting class devoted primarily toward control
over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power the MAGE taps
into to influence the world.  MAGE spells are devoted to the invoking,
hermetic, and combative nature.  MAGEs fare a little better than their
CLERIC counterparts in hand-to-hand combat though they much prefer to
stand back and roast their enemies with a FIREBALL or SUNBURST.  
~
-1 THI THIEF~
The THIEF class can be characterized as a WARRIOR who dropped out of school
to pursue more "profitable" means of living.  These wirey persons have
physical endurance slightly less than that of a WARRIOR but are much more
agile.  A THIEF uses trickery and shadows to achieve their goals.  They can
SNEAK around silently, POISON WEAPONs, and can HIDE unusually well.  They are
also adept at SEARCHing for hidden objects and doors.
~
-1 PSI PSIONICS PSIONICIST~
The PSIONICIST class is a spellcasting class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.
The psionicist also has a unique way of silently casting spells.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
~
0 GHOST~
When traveling in the night, beware of GHOSTS.  Fortunately, sunlight is
a bane for these representatives of the dead.
~
0 'ADRENALINE CONTROL'~
Syntax: cast 'adrenaline control' 

By controlling the production and release of adrenaline in his or her system, 
the psionicist can gain temporary boosts in dexterity and constitution.  This 
control cannot be initiated during battle because, hey, even psionicists get a 
little excited from time to time.
~
0 AGITATION~
Syntax: cast 'agitation' <target>

This skill is nearly identical to the Mage spell BURNING HANDS.  With this 
skill, a psionicist can cause the cells in his or her victim to become
agitated, moving so fast as to cause burn damage.
~
0 AWE~
Syntax: cast 'awe' <target>

With this discipline, a skilled spellcaster can use the power of his or
her mind to affect the morale of an opponent.  If successful, the enemy
will be overcome by awe for the psionicist, and will simply forget to
fight.  Of course, aggressive monsters will revert to their true nature
after only a brief lull in the action.
~
0 'BALLISTIC ATTACK'~
Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' <character>

BALLISTIC ATTACK lets a psionicist use the powers of his or her mind to throw 
small objects, usually a rock or other debris that happens to be in the area,
at the target.  The results can be rather amusing to the psionicist, and
painful to the victim.
~
0 'BIOFEEDBACK'~
Syntax: cast 'biofeedback'

BIOFEEDBACK is the power with which a psionicist controls the flow of blood 
through his or her body.  This control allows the psionicist to reduce
bleeding, as well as cushion blows against him or her, effectively reducing
the damage by half.  Mind over body indeed...
~
0 'CELL ADJUSTMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'cell adjustment'

A skilled psionicist can also perform CELL ADJUSTMENT, which can remove both 
curses and poisons from his or her body.
~
0 'COMBAT MIND'~
Syntax: cast 'combat mind'

A psionicist using COMBAT MIND has a very keen understanding of his or her 
enemies and their fighting tactics.  As a result, the psionicist has an 
increased chance of hitting his or her enemies, and knows how to minimize the 
damage received from their blows.  Because psionicists are telepathinc, this 
knowledge can also be shared with the his or her companions.
~
0 'CONTROL FLAMES'~
Syntax: cast 'control flames' <target>

With this skill, a psionicist can will the flames in his or her light source to
leap out and strike an enemy.  And if you don't think your light source uses a 
flame, well, you're wrong.  You just aren't looking close enough.
~
0 'DEATH FIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'death field'

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionicists
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor
damage.
~
0 'DETONATE'  'DISINTEGRATE'~
Syntax: cast 'detonate'     <target>
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <target>

With both of these skills, a psionocist uses his or her mind to affect the 
latent energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough to 
the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason, most 
psionocists choose the victim itself as the target, since there's bound to be 
SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.  Mid-level psionicists can DETONATE 
objects on their victim, and extremely skilled psionicists can even
DISINTEGRATE their victims, killing them instantly.
~
0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' 'DISPLACEMENT' 'FLESH ARMOR'
  'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'
Syntax: cast 'displacement'
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in place
by the psionicist's will.

DISPLACEMENT makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her actual
position, thus making him or her more difficult to hit.

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an 
armor-like substance.

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other 
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

INERTIAL BARRIER creates a barrier of positive energy that reduces the damage 
infliced by creatures of negative energy.
~
0 'DOMINATION'~
Syntax: cast 'domination' <target>

With this skill, the caster can DOMINATE the mind of his or her intended 
victim, causing the victim to do exactly as the psionicist says.  As with
CHARM, the actions of dominated characters affect the status of the dominator;
don't whine if you get a KILLER flag.
~
0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <target>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or 
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of 
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
~
0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy 
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~
0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' <object>

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects, 
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot
rearrange its molecules.
~
0 'MIND THRUST' 'INFLICT PAIN' 'PSYCHIC CRUSH' 'PSIONIC BLAST' 'ULTRABLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust'   <target>
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain'  <target>
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <target>
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <target>
Syntax: cast 'ultrablast'    <target>

With these skills, a psionicist can telepathically cause damage to the neural 
synapses of his or her victim.  The devotions are listed in increasing order of
damage inflicted.
~
0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <target>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or her own
expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~
0 'PROJECT FORCE'~
Syntax: cast 'project force' <target>

If a psionicist successfully PROJECTS FORCE, the force of his or her mind will 
strike against the victim's body, causing moderate damage.
~
0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <target>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~
0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <target>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist
does not become too weak.

By what name shall you be known within the mud? ~
0 PKILL -1~
These are the Pkilling rules of Stormgate.  Violate them and you may find
yourself without pkilling rights anymore.

1.  The pkill timer and death timer are both 15 minutes of real time in
length.  The pkill timer begins when a character is pkilled.  The death
timer begins whenever a character is killed.

2.  No spam killing.  This means that you may not kill a person over and
over and over, constantly.  You must wait until the pkill timer runs out
before you kill the same person again.  It is the responsibility of the
players to keep track of this time.  During this time, you may not attack,
push, summon, or in any other way affect that player without their
expressed permission.

2b. You may not push, summon, drag, or in any other way affect any player
without said players expressed permission, if the death timer exists.  For
example, if a player is killed by any means, you may not push/summon the
player in order to keep him from obtaining his corpse.

3.  If you are not a pkill player, you may not interfere with a pkill
battle in any way, be it directly or indirectly.

4.  If you are a pkill player, you may not interfere with a pkill battle
if you can not legally attack all participants of said battle.  If you can
not confirm the level of one of the participants, you are to assume that
the character is out of your range, and thus, can not attack.

5.  The taking of dropped equipment as a result of pkill combat is legal.
This includes items with the no-keep flag, or any weapons dropped during the
battle.  This also includes any equipment thrown from the opponent because
of a spell or skill effect.

6.  If a player quits the mud, their pkill timer (rule 2) becomes void.
Note that this DOES NOT reset the death timer (rule 2b).  Attacking
another player also causes the pkill timer to become void.  Note this DOES
reset the death timer (rule 2b).

7.  If you are a pkill character, you may not affect another pkill
character in any way if they are not within your level range, without
their expressed permission.  If they're in the middle of a pkill fight
don't do it at all, even if you do have their permission.

8.  If you are a non-kill character, you may not affect any other
character in any way whatsoever, without their expressed permission.

9.  If you venture into a Clan HQ, the owners of that clan HQ can kill
you at any time, regardless of timers, regardless of level, and even
regardless of Pkill status.  If you go into a Clan HQ, watch your neck!
This also allows you to go into another HQ and kill that clans members
as often as you wish. 

Any violation of any of these rules can result in the purge of your
equipment, the removal of your ability to speak, the erasure of your
character, or any other punishment the immortals deem proper.

More rules will be added if necessary.  See also: RULES, IMMLAWS

1 PLAYERUPDATE~
Chronological order of all Player Updates are as follows.

* v1    * Dec 28, 1998 *
Implementation of the Automatic Player Update routine.

* v1.00 * Dec 28, 1998 *
Player files are set up to function with ch->updated, the new variable
to keep track of what version of the MUD players are using.  Tests are
done to make sure a crash will not result.  All things go according
to plan.

* v1.01 * Dec 28, 1998 *
It is deemed that too much gold exists in the land.  Player files and
area files have been automatically updated in a GREAT reduction of
available gold in the land.  This is done for two reasons.  Firstly,
object damage has a direct relation to its value.  If the value is too
high, the object is basically indestructable.  This is not good.  The
second reason is for an upcoming new feature to the MUD, player built
and owned houses/buildings.

* v1.02 * Jan 18, 1999 *
A small bug is fixed in the way gold is handled.  Several new character
fields are defined, rQuestPoints, rNextQuest, rCountdown, rQuestObj,
and rQuestMob.  These will be used for religious auto-questing, which will
be explained at a later date.  Also, several bugs regarding regular
questing have been fixed.

* v1.03 * Jan 18, 1999 *
Fixed a dramatic bug involved with crosschecking questpoints and
rquestpoints.  Fixed a few other bugs with commands totally unrelated
to the questing system.  Changed "prayer" from a skill to a spell.

* v1.04 * Mar 16, 1999 *
Code added to reset clans.  All pfiles stripped of clan stats. Clan scores
reset.  Work changed in rQuest again (sigh).  We're getting there folks.

* v1.05 and v1.06 * Apr 19, 1999 *
TONS of bug fixes, totally rewrote religions.  Now keeps track of
followers via RELIGIONINFO command.  RELIGIONS command added.  Religion
Editor added to OLC.  More spells and group spells added.  New Object
Handler tested and functioning.

* v1.07 * Apr 26, 1999 *
Few more bug fixes here and there.  New OLC commands debugged.  Start
of Infinite Remort system has been implemented.  More details to follow.
Reset the religion scores (again).

* v1.08 * Mar 13, 1999 *
More bug fixes.  A problem with the OLC and editing has been fixed.  Old
objects have now been deleted from player files. 

* v1.09 * Jul 21, 1999 *
Ghost code added.  Mount code prelim started.  See HELP DEATH.

* v1.10 * Sept 20, 1999 *
Ghost code debugged.  Again.  Slowly recovering 2.5 months of code loss.
Web page has not been updated in a long period of time.

SEE HELP PLAYERUPDATE_2
~
1 PLAYERUPDATE_2~
* v1.11 * Mar 13, 2000 *
I've returned to coding.  Clans reset.

* v1.12 * Dec 20, 2001 *
Clan reset.  Few other things.  Not too much touching of the pfiles lately.

* v1.13 * Apr 16, 2002 *
New shields code added.  Altered combat code.  Fixed Berserk/Bloodthirsty.
Many other changes.

* v1.14 * v1.15 * Apr 16, 2002 *
Shield code tweaked, fixed. OLC updated.  New skills added.

* v1.16 * May 12, 2002 *
Cleanstat function executed.  OLC updated again.  Changed shields AGAIN, 
this time it works correctly.

* v1.17 * May 23, 2002 *
Update of Gold and Bank Accounts.  Cleaned up issues with the Economy.

* v1.18 * June 15, 2002 *
Added a new field to the player data, set it to 0 by default.  Mkills.

* v1.19 * June 21, 2002 *
Added a new field to the player data, set it to 0 by default.  Mount Code.

* v1.20 - 1.26 * Jan 20, 2005 *
Setting up the new Poison code, and LOTS more.

* v1.27 - v1.29 * Mar 11, 2005 *
Setting up the new prac system, projectile attacks, shots, much more.  This
help file will no longer be updated.  See www.stormgate.ca, under the forums,
for future update information.

50 LSET~
Syntax: lset <target> <language> <value>
Syntax: lset <target> all <value>
Syntax: lset <target> learn <value>

lset set's a players language settings, with lset all, you can give
all languages a value, this is a value between 0 (not) and 100 (always)
With lset learn, you can set a players learning options, the times he
may try to learn a new language (like practices and trains)

Example:lset maniac all 100   (Give maniac all languages)
        lset arshole all 0    (Take all languages away from arshole)
        lset maniac learn 15  (Give maniac 15 learning sessions)
~
50 MARRY~
Syntax: marry <target1> <target2> [undo]

With this command, 2 players can get married, this ceremony has to
be done by a god from the mud who has the rights to marry people.

With the optional undo argument, players can get divorced again.
(But this was not meant to be this was <grin>)

SEE ALSO: DIVORCE, NEWRING
~
50 DIVORCE~
Divorce is a call to marry with the word undo added to the command.

SEE ALSO: MARRY, NEWRING
~
50 NEWRING~
Syntax: newring <target>

	This command is used internally, by the marriage code, but can also
	be used by gods to give characters back a lost wedding ring/band
~
51 RENAME~
Syntax: rename <target> <name>

This command changes the name of a character to newname, the code was
written by Erwin S. Andriesen.

You cannot rename a character to an already existing character or a
normally illegal name.
~
0 LEARN LANGUAGES SPEAK~
Syntax: learn
Syntax: learn <language>
Syntax: speak
Syntax: speak <language>

LEARN without an argument tells you what languages there are availeble
and how good you are at them.

LEARN with an argument lets you learn the language, if you at a teacher
who is willing to teach you the language. Learning a language costs money
(teachers are not free you know) and a learning session.

SPEAK without an argument tells you which language you are currently
speaking.

SPEAK with an argument switches which language you are speaking to a new
one.

                         **********************
                         **    The Rules     **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs, or even giving them help.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Do not use your immortal to resolve a dispute with your own mortal.
    Note: This ESPECIALLY governs Pkill!

for these can change without any notice.
 
1. Cheating will not be tolerated in any form, such as exploitng bugs,
   duplicating equipment, etc.
 
2. Foul language is allowed *only* on the mutter channel.

7. Multiplaying IS now legal..  However, if you're going to play more
   one character at once, there are a few rules.  You may NOT have more
   than one character on if he/she/it is pkill.  You may NOT get involved
   in pkill fights if you have more than one character on.  If you are
   summoned to a pkill room against your will, and attacked, just fight
   with the attacked character, and log off your others as soon as possible.
   Don't even THINK about raiding rival clans or entering the Arena with 
   multiple characters.

8. You may not loot another players corpse without said players
   permission.

9. Do NOT share characters with any other player.  This includes
   giving away all or some of your equipment to other players just

~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
101 HEDIT~
Command:
% hedit <name>
% hedit create <name>
asave 0 to save help files
~
105 ARGLIST~
The mobprog arglist changes from type to type.
For most types it is a percentage (1-100), and on others it is keywords
or an ammount.
I.e., for the hit_prcnt_prog, it's a percentage.. namely if the arglist is 30,
then when the mobs hp is at 30% or less of max, then the prog is triggered.
For give_prog, the arglist is all the keywords of the object to trigger that program
when the object is given to the mob.
And for all_greet_prog, arglist is a percentage, 100 will make the prog run
whenever anyone enters the room (excluding invis imms).
~
106 RESTRICT~
Syntax: restrict [commandname] [level]
Syntax: restrict [commandname] log [logtype]
 
Commandname is the name of the command you wish to change the level or
logtype of, you can use shortforms of commands giving there aren't any
other commands with those sames letters or you may not get the one you
wish. :)  Logtype is the type of logging you wish a command to have,
type restrict by itself for quick syntax and the logtypes.  Also,
it is possible to type:  restrict all [firstcmd#] [secondcmd#]
for a listing of commands and the levels which they are currently at.
Firstcmd# is the first command you wish to list from, and secondcmd#
is the number of the command you wish to list to.
~
101 WRLIST~
Syntax: wrlist [type(r/o/m/p)] [lvnum] [uvnum]
 
Wrlist lists the vnums and names of the items in those vnums.  You can list
room vnums and their names with r, objects with o, and mobs with m.  When
listing rooms, it also shows you the resets in each room.  Lvnum is the
beginning vnum you wish to list from, and uvnum is the ending vnum.
Note, with m, if the mob has mobprogs, it will list each of the
different types of mobprogs the mob has.  P will list all the mobs with
mobprogs within the range.  It will show the full mobprog: type, arglist,
AND comlist, unlike with m.
~
106 VUSED~
Vused simply lists all the blocks of vnums which have been created to date.
The last line it shows tells you just how many free vnums there are. :)

, etc.
 $i   the name of the mob being triggered
 $I   the mobs short description
 $n   the name of the mob/pc triggering the mobprog

0 HUMAN HUM~
A very ordinary class, without any enhancements or drawbacks.
Good for players who are new to MUD games in general.  Humans receive a
bonus practice every level. 
~
0 ELF~
Elves are smarter than the average race, making them good spellcasters,
but their gain is offset by their loss of hitpoints.  They can naturally
detect the hidden, and have infrared eyes.
Str: -2, Int: +4, Wis: 0, Dex: +2, Con: -2,
~
0 HALFELF HLF~
Halfelves are a crossbreed between humans and elves.  They have the infrared
eyes of their elf half, but not as many stat advantages.
Str: -1, Int: +2, Wis: 0, Dex: +1, Con: -1
~
0 DWARF DWA~
With more hitpoints than most races, these stocky people make for good
warriors.  They lose out on dexterity though.  They have infrared eyes, and
can see the hidden.
Str: +4, Int: -3, Wis: -1, Dex: -2, Con: +3
~
0 HALFDWARF HDW~
With more hitpoints that the average human, these shorter people are
difficult to discern from humans.  They have infrared eyes.
Str: +2, Int: -2, Wis: 0, Dex: -1, Con: +2
~
0 HOBBIT HOB~
A short race, usually used for cooks or slaves.  They do not have very many

see the hidden.
Str: -2, Int: +1, Wis: 0, Dex: +1, Con: -1
~
0 GIANT GIA~

For all spell casting classes, once you reach a certain level, you recieve 
spells which you may practice, and then cast.  There are spells devoted to
protection, attack, healing, and one or two other miscellaneous subject
areas.  To be able to cast a spell, it must be practiced to at least 1% or
higher, otherwise you will eternally lose concentration.  Spell casting costs
vampires blood points, and with all other spell casting classes it costs mana.
How much mana or how many blood points it takes, is mainly dependant on what
kind of spell it is and how many levels you have been able to practice it.  As
you gain levels, spells that you had on previous levels will drop in mana/bp
cost.  To see how much mana/bp your currently practiced spells will
cost to cast, you may type SPELLS.  Typing PRACTICE will list all currently
practiced spells and skills.  Also, to see all the spells and skills that
your class will recieve, type SLIST.

~
-1 INVOKE~
INVOKE
Syntax: invoke <item>
 
The invoke command allows a player to call forth the power of a magical
artifact.
~
-1 DRAG~
DRAG
 
Syntax: drag <target> <directions>
 
This command is similiar to "push", except the person doing the dragging is
also moved in that direction.  This command works only on targets who are
resting or sleeping.
~
-1 PUSH~
PUSH
 
Syntax: push <target> <direction>
 
If succesful, this command moves the target in the specified direction.
~
50 ATALL~
ATALL ALL <action>
ATALL MORTALS <action>
ATALL GODS <action>
ATALL MOBS <action>
ATALL EVERYWHERE <action>


Executes action several times, either on ALL players (not including yourself),
MORTALS (including trusted characters), GODS (characters with level higher than
L_HERO), MOBS (Not recommended) or every room (not recommended either!)

If you insert a # in the action, it will be replaced by the name of the target.

If # is a part of the action, the action will be executed for every target
in game. If there is no #, the action will be executed for every room containg
at least one target, but only once per room. # cannot be used with ATALL 
EVERYWHERE and with ATALL MOBS. # can be anywhere in the action.

We are you not to use the ATALL command unless it is really needed, which
it is almost never, this command causes the mud to lag a LOT, since it
does a lot of commands in one go.

Example:

ATALL ALL SMILE -> you will only smile once in a room with 2 players.

Destroying the characters this command acts upon MAY cause it to fail. Try to
avoid something like ATALL MOBS PURGE (although it actually works at my MUD).

The command works by transporting the character to each of the rooms with
target in them. Private rooms are not violated.
~
0 IRON GRIP~
Syntax: iron
 
This skill allows you to get a firmer grip on your weapon, making it harder
for your opponent to disarm you.
~
0 'ENHANCED DAMAGE TWO'~
This skill increases the damage you inflict when attacking.  Use of this

0 'CIRCLE~
Syntax: circle

hard hit from behind.  
~
0 MPROGS~
Mobprograms are a way to make your mobs more interesting. This basic
version has enough to get things going, and should be quite readable and
understandable and more to the point, extendable. the remainder of this book
describes Mobprograms and gives a couple trivial examples.

See also: VARIABLES, FLOWCONTROL, OPERATORS, SPEC, TRIGGERS, MPCOMMANDS
~
0 TRIGGERS~
Triggers are fairly easy to add, but this basic list should hold for most
needs. Their names, argument list syntaxes, and translation into more
available articulate english are given below:
Syntax: in_file_prog
   The argument is a single word which is the location of the stored file as
referenced from the running directory(MopProgs).
NOTE: Dummy trigger. Not valid in any file, only for use in loading files from
the first method described two chapters above.
Syntax: act_prog[p]
   The argument is a list of keywords seperated by spaces. If the first word
is the character 'p' by itself then the rest of the word list is considered to
be a phrase. The trigger is activated whenever a keyword(or phrase) is 
is contained in the actO message. Both the phrase and keywords are case
insensitive.
NOTE: Most general trigger. Applies to almost every event which happens in
the mud. Anytime the function actO is called with a message to be delivered
TO_CHAR, TO_VICT, TO_ROOM, etc. the act can be triggered. Basically this will
trigger on almost everything you'll ever want(and some things you won't as
well). For example: Mobprogram: >act_prog p pokes you in the ribs.- is a 
trigger will only be activated if a mobile receives a message in which the
above five words are found in the exact order and spacing given. Note that
the period is needed because the words must be found on their own. This
eliminates confusion when the keyword 'hi' and a message with the word 'this'
is being checked.
Syntax: speech_prog[p]
   The same as for an act_prog
NOTE: This is only triggered when the keyword or phrase is contained in a
message which has been said by the PC in the same room as the mob. The PC 
restriction is not necessary, but makes infinite loops between two talking
mobs impossible. It also makes it impossible for two NPC's to stand and 
discuss the weather however.
Syntax: rand_prog
   The argument is a number between 1 and 100 inclusive.
NOTE: This trigger is checked at each PULSE_MOBILE and if the argument is
greater than a percentage roll the trigger is activated. This will happen
even if there is no PC in the room with the mob, but there must be players
in the same area. It is useful to give mobs a bit of personality. For 
instance a janitor who stops to spit tobacco, or complain about the hours.
or wonder why there are no woman janitors on muds, or a fido which barks or
growls or pees on the curb is much more alive than one which just sits there
scavenging.
Syntax: fight_prog
   Argument is a percentage like in rand_prog.
NOTE: Useful for giving mobiles combat attitude. It is checked every PULSE_
VIOLENCE when the mobile is fighting. Can be used to cast spells, curse at
the opponent, or whatever. Only the first successful one will be processed
at the opponent, to save time. Also this means that the mob won't get lucky
and 1.curse, cast a fireball and 2.spit on the player, cast another fireball
in the same pulse.
Syntax: hitprcnt_prog
   The argument is a percentage.
NOTE: Is activated at each PULSE_VIOLENCE when the mob is fighting. It checks
to see if the hitpoints of the mob are below a given percentage. Multiple
hitprcnt_progs should be listed in increasing order of percent since 40% will
always be activated before a 20% and, only the first successful hitprcnt 
trigger is performed.
Syntax: greet_prog
   Again a percentage argument.
NOTE: Whenever someone enters the room with the mob, and the mob saw the
person enter, this is checked. Good for shopkeepers who want to welcome
customers, or for pseudo-aggressive mobs which need to discriminate on who
they attack.
Syntax: all_greet_prog
   Again a percentage argument.
NOTE: Like greet_prog, but it can be triggered even if the mob didn't see the 
arrival(i.e. sneak, invisible, etc). Most useful for faking teleport rooms(if
your mob can transfer) or for impassible guardians.
**NOTE: Neither greet_prog is activated if the mob is fighting**
~
0 FLOWCONTROL~
In place of any legal mud command in a Mobprogram, one can substitute a 
flow of control command. Here is the syntax for a flow of control command.
"if" "{if_check_1}"("{argument}")}[{operator}{value}]NL
["or"""{if_check_2}"("{argument}")"[{operator}{value}]NL]
["or"""{if_check_N}"("{argument"}")"[{operator}{value}]NL]
   [{program_command_1}NL]
   [{program_command_2}NL]
      .  .  .
   ["break"NL]
      .  .  .
   [{program_command_N}NL]
["else"NL]
   [{program_command_1}NL]
   [{program_command_2}NL]
      .  .  .
   ["break"NL]
      .  .  .
   [{program_command_N}NL]
"endif"NL
   Basically, it is: an "if" line followed by zero or more "or" lines, 
followed by zero or more legal mud commands, which may contain a "break" line
, possibly followed by an "else" line, followed by zero or more legal mud
commands, which may contain a "break" line, followed by an "endif" line. The
only new syntax labels are all in the IF line:
---Explainations
   An IF_CHECK is a string which describes under what context to compare 
things.
   The ARGUMENT is the reference point from which the LHS of an extension
comes.
   The OPERATOR indicates how the LHS and RHS are going to be compared.
   The VALUE is the RHS of the expression to be compared to the operator.
   The BREAK command bails out of the entire Mobprogram regardless of the
level if nesting.
   If that looks confusing, skip to the end of the book and review the example
Hopefully that should clear things, otherwise you'll probably have to give
us a mail since the examples are the best way we know to explain syntax.
~
0 OPERATORS~
Most of the basic operators are legal and perform the same function as in C
The string operators are a bit more confusing. There are negative versions of
some of the operators. These are not strictly needed, since the if/else 
construct of the Control Flow commands can handle either case.
*Numeric Opertators: If_checks in control flow
   The provided list of if_checks and their arguments are below. They should
all be fairly obvious in what they do, but some of the more obtuse deserve a
slight explanation. Any '==' operator can be replaced with any of the 
available ones described above. The argument ($*) refers to any of the 
variables which make sense for that if_check(i.e. for an if_check which is
referencing a person the only valid variables would be $i, $n, $t or $r). A
value type of string is a sequence of characters. It doesn not need to be 
included in quotes or anything like that (i.e. name($n)== orc large brown).
 
rand(num) <> Is random percentage less than or equal to num
isnpc($*) <> Is $* an NPC
ispc($*) <> IS $* a PC
isgood($*) <> Does the $* have a good alignment
isfight($*) <> Is $* fighting
isimmort($*) <> Is the level of $* greater than max_mortal
ischarmed($*) <> Is $* affected by charm

isaffected($*)&integer <> Is ($*->affected by & integer) true {person only}
hitprcnt($*)==percent <> IS the hit/max_hit of $* equal to percent
inroom($*)==integer <> Is the room of $* equal to the integer
sex($*)==integer <> Is the sex of $* equal to integer
position($*)==integer <> Is the position of $* equal to integer
level($*)==integer <> Is the level of $* equal to integer
class($*)==integer <> Is the class of $* equal to integer
goldamt($*)==integer <> Does $* have a gold total equal to integer
objtype($*)==integer <> Is the type of $* equal to integer (armor, boat, etc.)
objval#($*)==integer <> $*->value[#]equal to integer (# from 0-3)
number==integer <> The vnum of $* equal to integer
name==string <> The name of $* equal to string

by anyone, regardless of your PK status, and regardless of your level.
There are no restrictions inside the HQs, except that the 30th level
minimum for combat still applies.  Note this only applies to players
who have entered the HQs on their own terms.  You may NOT break any
pkill rules in order to get a victim into an HQ.

     The above commands are used to expand the game world.  The original code
it is based on was written by Surreality and installed in The Isles by Locke.
It was then converted to work with Envy by Jason Dinkel.

     Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives
help. AEDIT and REDIT default to the current area or room. EDIT ROOM RESET
resets the current room.  Most commands with no arguments display syntax.

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example, if you are equipping a mobile, don't load a container in the 
room and fill it with some objects and then continue equipping the mobile.
It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

0 'SOUND EFFECTS'~
This MUD now supports the MSP, or Mud Sound Protocol.  AmiMUD (for the
Amiga), Zmud 4.62 or higher, or Pueblo are examples of clients that
support the MSP.  This means that the MUD will now make sounds instead
of just text.  See below for instructions on how to turn on the MSP if you
are using zMUD.

Instructions for Zmud:
  Click the SOUNDS optin in the Prefs, the MSP General subgroup.
  Check the "Enable MUD Sound Protocol" checkbox.
  Check the "Allow Inline MSP" checkbox.
  Be sure the "Echo MSP Triggers" option is turned OFF/UNCHECKED.

  Click the GENERAL SOUNDS tab.
  Be sure the "Enable Sounds" option is checked.
  It is also recommended that the connect and disconnect sounds are blank.

The WAV and MIDI files are now available on  the web page, on the main
menu.  Simply download the zips, and extract them to your Stormgate
directory (or wherever they go on your client), and you're all done.

The last step, is to turn on the MSP for each of your characters.  To do this,
simply type "config +sound" and "config +music" to turn on the sound and
music.

Thats it!

All "bullets" are to be cast like a spell.  The NAME field is the name of the spell,
but it is more than likely not the damage message.  For example, the "Crossbow
Bullet" would say "Xander's crossbow bolt hits the target (235 pts)", it would not
say "Crossbow Bullet".  A speed of 12 is the equivalent speed of a fireball spell.

Hammerheim is a boisterous metropolis well-known for it's inhabitants rough
ways.

marble splendor.  Though known for it's serene setting and friendly citizens,
dark rumors have been recently begun circulating regarding the vast system
of caverns reputed to lie beneath it.
~
0 ASHAKAR~
Though few accounts of the ancient city of Ashakar have survived, it is believed
to have lay somewhere along the long-abandoned trade routes that ran through the
Naratian Desert a millenium ago.  It was abandoned during a period of intense
drought, and left for the sands to claim.  The Ashakarian culture is thought to
have been the dominant civilization of that time, and sages have recently proven
that the ancient Ashakarian language forms the basis of the modern human tongue.
~
0 'STONEGATE CASTLE'~
Lying deep in the mountains to the south of the Naratian Desert, the enigmatic 
fortress is reputed to be a nexus of timelines; who rules this keep, and what
its ultimate purpose is, remains a mystery.

A mist-shrouded, cursed valley found in the western woods, Blackmoore's Hollow
has acquired a fearsome reputation as a home to creatures of darkness.
~
0 GRASFEL~
Little is known of this region; it contains the town of Cebu, and the Drow
homeland of Anxi.
~
0 DRAGON VALLEY~
Located on the pass between the Dravenov and Rathasia forests, most travellers
give a wide berth to this valley, the dragon homeland.
~
0 RELFAUST~
Though once a small commercial town located in the shadow of Mount Heaven,
Relfaust has recently fallen to an unknown force, and most travellers try
to avoid it if they can.
~
0 'SILVER CASTLE'~
Home to King Elton, ruler of the western forestlands, the Silver Castle has
long stood as a bastion of truth and justice in these dark times.  The
King's Law is enforced by the Silver Knights, a legendary order of formidable
warriors.
~
0 'OVERWORLD TOWNS'~
In addition to major towns and cities, several smaller villages dot the landscape,
such as the half-dwarf town of Cutter's Scarp, the Elder village of Starwind, the
Minotaur stronghold of Khara-Gor, and the Giant hall of Nordheim.

A strange climatic abnormality located on the southwest part of the continent
has created a dense, tropical forest inhabited by strange creatures.
~
0 FUTURE~

relate of vast changes, and speak of strange machines that roar over the land,
and horrible weapons that can destroy entire cities.
~
0 PAST~
Little is known of the distant past, but some magi have managed to construct
magical portals and travel thousands of years in the past.  They report
strange creatures, primitive tribespeople, and an almost total lack of
civilization.
~
0 'DEATHFANG MANOR'~
Most sensible people shun this brutal fortress, known for its brutal master.
The few that enter rarely leave; at least, they rarely leave alive.
~
0 ZIGGURAT~
Recently travellers have reported sighting a mysterious black ziggurat in the
forests north of Methidoral.  Its purpose remains unknown.
~
0 'SERF VILLAGE'~
In stark contrast to the magnificent city of Methidoral are the poverty-ridden
towns that surround it.  In them poor peasants labor for unfeeling masters,
and disease and crime are rampant.
~
0 'TAR PITS'~
Woe to any who fall prey to these black pools of doom; they shall join the
bony legions who have fallen before them.
~
0 'SUMMERSET ISLE'~
A mist-shrouded island off the west coast, Summerset Isle is the original
homeland of the Feline race.  While the Feline residents are generally
tolerant of visitors, one would be wise not to offend any of these fierce
warriors.
~
0 'BLACK TOWER'~
Stretching out from the snow-covered mountains of the north, the fearsome
Black Tower is home to an order of dark magi.  One would be unwise to
enter this dreaded edifice.
~
0 VALHALLA~
Inhabited by a race of immortals, the mighty halls of Valhalla ring loudly

mettle in battle should come there; but be warned--few warriors are a
match for the lovely but deadly Valkyries.

troll race.

0 'VIKING SHIP'~
In recent years fierce bands of northern barbarians have raided the coastlines.
One such ship is rumored to have landed on the southern coast; it's possible
that it still is there.
~
-1 STARTINGMULTICLASS~
Multiclassing is an option available to you on Stormgate, but you can
also start your adventuring life as a single class character as well.
Multiclassing from the start can get you going in the word very quickly, but
you can also suffer some disadvantages that your single class friends
receive.
 
Single class characters can become multiclass at a later point in their
adventuring careers. Upon level 100 they can REMORTALIZE to a multiclass.
When you remortalize you begin life at level 2 again, but you start
with 1500hp (instead of 100hp) and you also get to keep all of the
practices you gained the first time through. In the end this can add
up to over 3000hp difference between a character who started multiclass
and a character who start single class and remortalized.
 
Choose carefully!
 
~
-1 STARTINGPK~
PK (or Player Killer) is an option that you choose upon starting your
life as an adventurer.  You either wish to live your life peacefully (as
peaceful as killing monsters may be) or you may choose the life of a
murderer attempting to slay your fellow player.
 
PK has some advantages, namely that there is no cap on experience. Non-PK
players are limited to 450 for single class, 225 for multiclass, per kill.
PK players get no such limit.
 
The only thing you lose in PK is... nothing! You don't leave a corpse,
and you don't get any disadvantages. You show back up at your temple
as good as new. You may have to beware thieves though!
 
Many seasoned players will start characters as peaceful single class and
remortalize pkill later so they are not picked on while levelling (even
thought there are deterrants in place to discourage such behaviour).

By use of this spell a spellcaster can shoot a small jolt of electricity

By learning these skills you will be better with the type of corresponding
weapon. This means you may hit more often, and hit harder after learning
a proficiency skill and wield the appropriate weapon type.
~
0 BREATHE 'BREATHE WATER'~
A spellcaster who learns this spell and then casts it will be able to
breathe water like it was air. This means you will not drown if you
are in an underwater area.

0 BREATHE 'BREATHE FIRE'~
Characters who are DRAGONS may use this race skill to begin fights.

extreme amounts of damage.

~
0 LEGEND 'LEGEND SKILL' 'LEGEND SPELL'~

labeled as a LEGEND. Becoming a legend is better than being a DEMIGOD

noted in the help file.
~
0 'TOMBA DI VEMON'~
This is a LEGEND SPELL.
 
Vampires have long been known to burrow beneath the earth when they
are hurt or in danger, and those found upon the lands of Stormgate are
no different.
 
The mighty vampire Vemon was the first of his kind to bend the will of
the earth to his own, and have it heal him quickly while buried beneath
the topsoil.
 
A Vampire may not move or fight until completely healed, and is
invisible to all but the keenest eyes in this state.
~
0 'AXE KICK'~
Syntax: use 'Axe Kick' [target]
 
A secret attack of the assassin class, this skill pulls on the
Assassin's innate martial arts training to bring down a powerful kick
to devestate their opponents. Most definately not a skill to be taken
lightly in right, or wrong, hands.
~
0 'DECEPTION OF AURA'~
This is a LEGEND SKILL.
 
There was a time when Assasins ran rampant across the cities and lands
of Stormgate. They kept quiet and were silent death on the winds of the
night.
 
Over time, word leaked of the Assassins' names and their favourite
techniques were guarded against. The rulers of the kingdoms hired
mages to constantly SCRYE for those who were the most deadly and
sinister. The constant vigil soon led the the death of many who were
members of the guild.
 
During this dark time, an Assassin named Aura was able to remember
part of her Chi training, and partition her mind. She imagined herself
in one place, and then locked the rest away. This was effective in
misleading the Mages and led to a new age of Darkness.
~
0 'DEATH STRIKE'~
Syntax: use 'death strike'
 
Using the dark side of martial arts the learned assassin may choose
to attempt a devestating DEATH STRIKE on their injured opponent.
This once forbidden skill has now been circulated amongst the guild
and is one of the most deadly attacks in all of Stormgate.
~
0 'MIND OF FANOOM'~
This is a LEGEND SKILL.
 
The mightiest of Assassins, Fanoom, was fond of his dagger. So fond, in
fact, that he liked to use his ASSASSINATE skill more than most. The
problem here is that he was unable to flee and return to strike a
deadly blow again. What smart assassin would stay and fight an evenly
matched fight?
 
And so Fanoom practiced night after night, for years until he was able
to sneak up on even badly injured opponents.
 
Since then, Fanoom's technique has been spread to the rest of the
guild. Adding to their ever-growing arsenal.
~
0 LEAP~
Syntax: cast 'leap' target
 
By use of this spell a barbarian may increase the jumping power that
they innately have, and leap many many miles at a time. In order to
do so, though, the barbarian needs a target to jump to.
 
Both the Target and the Barbarian must both be outside, lest someone
suffer a broken neck when they hit the ceiling!
~
0 'LEAP OF TORFI'~
This is a LEGEND SKILL.
 
Syntax: cast 'leap of torfi' target
 
The grizzled barbarian, Torfi, loved to leap to and fro all day and
all night. Until one day he had a thought (possible the only
intellegent thought he ever had) that he could pair his leap skill
with an attack.
 
What came from this union is known as the Leap of Torfi. A devestating
attack, but useable only to start a battle. Beware missing your target
because you will be stunned and your target may retaliate or run!

Syntax: cast 'spectral armor'

0 'DAGGERS OF PAIN' 'SHARDS OF GLASS'~
Syntax: cast 'daggers of pain'
Syntax: cast 'shards of glass'
 
An illusionist will use these spells to hurt their opponents by
using their own minds against them. Both spells create illusionary
weapons flying towards the target, who in thinking they are going
to be hit by the projectiles end up hurting themselves.
~
0 'SHADOW IMAGE'~
Syntax: cast 'shadow image'
 
Use of this spell creates a doppleganger of oneself. This copy then
moves and acts exactly like the caster. When the doppleganger is hit
it still damages the caster, but protects the caster somewhat. The
copy will also retaliate when hit using magic.
~
0 'LIQUID SKIN' WATERSPIKE~
Syntax: cast 'liquid skin'
 
This spell makes the casters skin appear as if it were made of a
strange liquid. When touched the skin ripples as if a drop of water
had been dropped into it. When a hostile attack is made against the
caster the liquid will absorb some of the damage, and may retaliate
with a previously unknown spell known as 'WATERSPIKE'.
~
0 'NIRAKS CURSE OF THE DAMNED'~
This is a LEGEND SPELL.
 
Syntax: cast 'niraks curse of the damned' target

Those who are cursed by Nirak rarely survive.
~
0 DEMONSHIELD~
Syntax: cast 'demonshield'
 
This spell causes a swarm of demons to be called forth from the lower
planes to protect the caster from harm. The demons swirl around the
casters body and attempt to intercept any attack that is meant for
the caster, thereby reducing damage taken.
 
When the caster is hit, the demons may also retaliate with attacks of
their own!
~

0 'CIRCLE OF FIRE'~
~
0 'CIRCLE OF LOVE'~

Only the most powerful beings of Stormgate have been able to decipher

This spell infuses the target with the strength of a titan! Increasing

~
0 SKINNING TANNING~
Syntax: use 'skinning' <corpse>
Syntax: use 'skinning' <armor>
Syntax: use 'skinning' <leather1> <leather2>
Syntax: use 'tanning'  <leather> <yards> <item level>
 
The skills skinning and tanning allow a ranger to skin a corpse to create
leather, and then to tan the leather into an item.
 
Skinning may be used on a corpse, or it may be used on a piece of armor
that was tanned, to reclaim some of the leather. Depending on your level
of skill, you can get different grades of leather which will make your
armor different strengths.
 
Skinning may also be used on two different rolls of leather to create a larger
roll of leather. This is a necessary tactic in order to create higher level items.
 
Tanning must be done in a tannery. This brings out the magic properties
of the leather which was once part of the monster it belonged to. These
properties can make your tanned armor unpredictable, but also very strong!
You may leave out the item level parameter for the tanning skill, and you
will attempt to create an item equal to your current level.
