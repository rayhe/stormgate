~
>speech_prog methic dorat ice age old~
say Methic Dorat existed during the ice age, many many years ago.  What a life they must have had, living in caves their whole existences. They had some hard lives, let me tell you.  Having to hunt Sabre-Toothed Tigers, and Wooly Mammoths
say and what not. And the cold!! You think its cold now? This is nothing compared to what they had to endure! How could anyone ever survive back then?!?
shrug $n
~
>speech_prog survive survival live living life~
say That's a good question! I have no idea how they survived back then. It musta have been tough.
~
>speech_prog mage magus savior saved saver save helped helper help~
say Well, as i was telling you earlier, to this date, noone really knows who the magus was that saved Methidoral from the invaders. However, it has been rumored that if you could somehow go back into time, and go to Methidoral, as it was
say during this time, that you would be able to possibly find this mage, and discover who it is.  I am sure he could provide you with a lot of useful information, and you would be a hero for finding out who this person was!
laugh
say Travelling time! Hah! What a ridiculous thought! I have never heard of such utter nonsense.
chuckle
~
>speech_prog Middle Medieval Methidoral~
say Yes, it was called Methidoral back in those days.  That was at least seven or eight hundred years ago, though.  However, you can still see a few of the old buildings that are intact in parts of the city.  How things have changed!!
~
>speech_prog travelling travel~
say well, from what i hear, there is a certain doctor who believes in such nonsense, but not me!! I believe it is hogwash!
snicker
~
>speech_prog changed changes change~
say Well, most of the buildings haven't survived taht long, but there are a few that may be well hidden among the newer ones.  I have heard that one is so hidden that no one has found it yet.  I'm sure someone will...It is only a matter of time.
~
>speech_prog doctor believes believe believing~
say Yeah, there is this doctor in the hospital that talks of such nonsense.  I can't remember his name tho...perhaps Pong would. Go ask him, i'm sure he will know.
smile
~
>speech_prog hidden buildings building hide ~
say Well, i'm not sure where the buildings are either, but there is this on fellow i know of who might.  Go talk to the Jeff, i hear he knows a lotta secrets about the city. I can't guarentee that he will talk to you though.
~
>speech_prog Nonsense Hogwash utter~
stare $n
say The stuff about travelling time! What have you been listening to all this time?
~
>speech_prog listening listen you talking talk~
say Well, I certainly hope you have been listening to me! I'm not talking for my own health ya know!!
sigh 
~
>speech_prog Pong~
say Pong is one of the doctors in the hospital.  He is a nice guy, he will help you out.  He is pretty busy though.
~
>speech_prog Busy work~
say Well, Pong is a doctor after all. He is seeing patients all day. Don't take up anymore time than necessary.
~
>speech_prog jeff ~
nod
say Thats right, Jeff.  He is the fireman of the Methidoral City.  You can probably find him in the fire station most of the time. He knows many secrets about the city.
~
>speech_prog secrets secret about~
say He hasn't told me, but I have heard from a few dependable sources. They are secrets after all. Go talk to Jeff if you want to find out more.
~
>speech_prog dependable sources source few~
say Well, who they are is not important.  Just know that Jeff knows more about the city than most people.  He has to.  What would happen if he idn't know his way around and there was a fire somewhere!
gasp
~
>speech_prog Hospital~
say The hospital I am speaking of is Methidoral City General Hospital.  Geez, you are being silly now aren't you?
chcukle
~
>speech_prog silly silliness ~
sigh
say By pretending you aren't from here.  That's how you are being silly.  Now stop asking stupid questions.
slap $n
~
>speech_prog New City~
say Methidoral City is built over the same area where Methidoral lies.  I'm not going to tell you anymore about that...go out and explore for yourself.  Oh, and while your here, stop in at Humphrey's!
wink $n
~
>speech_prog Humphrey's~
say Humphrey's!! It's the most famous bar in all of Methidoral City.  You can find it on Laurentian Drive, west of Market Square.  I kinda like going there myself sometimes...maybe I could meet ya there later tonight...

>speech_prog future ~
say Who knows what the future holds!  All I hope is that Methidoral City will be around forever. 
~
>speech_prog mayor ~
say The mayor is in charge of the whole city!! Can you imagine that? What a responsibility he has.  Why are you in such a hurry...stay and talk for a while.  But if you must know, his name is Anthony.  If you really want to meet him, just say Anthony.
~
>speech_prog Anthony~

Methidoral City dates back almost 18,000 years, to the ice age.  Known as
Methic Dorat, it was built into caves and inhabited by Neandrathals.  From
those early days, it eventually became Methidoral during the Middle Ages and
was a city of great strategic importance.  This was during the times when
huns and various other raiding parties attacked the realms, sacking many
cities and laying waste to the countrysides.  Methidoral became the
stronghold, but after years of sustaining devastating attacks, it could hold
out no more.  At the point of near collapse, and with the enemy advancing,
Methidoral was surely ruined.  It was at about this same time that,
according to legend, a portal at the fountain opened, and a strange mage and
his minions stepped forth.  They wreaked havoc upon the invaders, beating
them back until they were no longer a threat to any town or village, let
alone Methidoral.  Needless to say, great celebrations were thrown in his
honor, but the mage seemed to care not.  While the celebrations and partying
were going on late into the night, the mage stepped into the portal once
more, and returned to where he came from.  The portal then closed behind
him, before any could follow.  To this day, the identity of the mage, and
his reasons for saving the city from destruction remain unknown.  But
without his assistance, the city would have surely fallen, and the whole
realms would have been next.  From those days, it has become Methidoral
City, the largest city in the land.  One of the more modern cities, it has
all of the conveniences that would be expected of such an important place. 
This is a great time to be alive, that's for sure.

book~
Time travel exists only in one place in the entire realms.  From this one
place, it is possible to go to the past, present and the future.  StoneGate
Castle is the place you must journey to.  From here, three portals stand
forever open.  One leads back in time to the Ice Age, to the very beginnings
of Methidoral City.  See Methidoral City as it was thousands upon thousands
of years ago.  One of the portals leads to Fountain Plaza, which stood at
the exact same place that our Clocktower stands today, almost 600 years ago.
The final portal leads to the Clocktower.  The very one that stands in
Methidoral City today.  This now makes it possible for people to travel
through time almost at will, posing many problems.  What would happen if a
band of uncivilized, heathen warriors from the past decided to come to
Methidoral City of today, destroying everything in sight?  This is a very
grave problem, and is not to be taken lightly.  When people are able to
travel through time, they can also bring items from their era.  I'm sure,
not many of you will believe this, but if one of you could follow my
directions and travel back in time, delivering a copy of this book to
someone, my theory would then be proven.

Within this chamber stands the great and ancient Hierophant.  He has
stood in this spot since long before the dawning of the realm, and shall
continue into eternity.  Standing directly in the centre of the room is a
huge altar carved from one solid granite stone.  It's surface is carved with
intricate designs and symbols.  It is here that the citizens of Methidoral
come to heal and rest, and to share in the glory of eternity.  
There is a sign here.

Crossing of King and Queen~
~

The crossing of Queen and King is busy, but the throng of people is still
bearable.  Every now and then, a fight erupts between an arrogant cop and
an equally arrogant thug.  Pyrotechnics, hacks, slashes, and screams
of pain fill the air.  Few people take notice of these actions because they
have grown accustomed to open feuding in the streets.  The police pay
little heed also, only stepping in when they believe the fight is
unjustified.

The market square is arguably the busiest intersection in all of
Methidoral.  Street vendors hawking illegal wares try to escape notice by the
police, hooligans run from one store to another collecting supplies
for journeys outside the town, and common citizens meander down the streets.
The whole intersection is a swirling vortex of colors, odors, and sounds. 
Clutching your head, you attempt to find a quieter place in the city.

each other as they vie for a good position in the crowd.  A small child
meanders out into the middle of the street and gets cut off from its mother.
The wailing from the child and the answering shrieks of terror from the
panicked mother gives you a headache.  To the south, King street appears to
be less busy, and a park can easily be seen.

sturdily barred.  The threat from an outside invasion is always present, and
Methidoral, with its great riches, is a prime target of raids.  The cityguards
look at you sternly, and question what business you have in the city.  In
the distance you can hear wagon wheels crunching over the road leading up to
the gate.

You are walking along Charles street east.  There are several large buildings

You are at the corner of Charles street and Fantasia.  It is ordinary in
every way, buildings lining the streets as usual, road signs here and there.
There is a parking garage to the north, and a set of lights hanging above
the street.  They change from red, to green, to amber, and repeat.  The two
streets lead off to the south and west.

Eastern gate of Methidoral~
~
~
The eastern gate of Methidoral is carefully guarded, and the gates are
heavily barred.  The city walls are at least 10 meters high and are made of
solid stone dragged in from the cliffs near the city.  The gates are equally
solid looking, and are made of the hardest oak.  The cityguards look at you
suspiciously, but they allow you to pass without any hardship.

Fischer Street North~
~
~
Fischer street is the beginning of one of the biggest residential areas
in Methidoral.  The houses here are made out of thick river stone and solid
wood from the nearby forest.  The roofs are thatched with tough marsh
grasses, and the entire structure is whitewashed.  Here and there, simple
touches made by the inhabitants have distinguished the otherwise identical
houses from each other.  Off in an alley, you hear the hiss of a stray cat.

nondescript residences of the city's inhabitants.  From the building on your
right, you hear the squall of a young child.  The answering slap can be
heard shortly afterward.

business which cannot afford the rent on a shop on Market street.  To the
east, the smell of baked goods wafts out onto the street.  The few houses
which line the street here are more run-down than the others you have seen
in Methidoral.  Most of these people depend on back-breaking labor in the
mines to support themselves.

residents of Methidoral.  There really isn't much reason for an adventurer to
be in this section of town, and the looks the residents give you are very
suspicious.  One woman in particular looks mistrustful, and she grabs her
child and runs with him into the nearest building.

Sitting down around a circular table are the members of the Methidoral
City council.  It is their job to decide on the laws that the city will
follow.  They do not appear to be pleased by your interruption and the head
of the council stands and begins to speak.

Mall Entrance~
~
~
You stand at the entrance to one of the more popular new inventions ---
the mall.  It is a large building which houses various different stores and
shops.  The size and complexity of these super shopping centres has grown
over the years, and now many of them include full sized ice rinks among
other amenities.

Entrance to Methidoral General Hospital~
~
~
You have entered Methidoral General Hospital.  As time has progressed,
hospitals have played a major role in prolonging the population's life span.
No longer do citizens die from easily curable diseases, such as smallpox and
tuberculosis.  The sickening smell of germicidals is almost overpowering.

Waiting Room~
~

The room is filled with grim faces either waiting for their name to be
called or waiting for news of their loved ones condition.  The chairs are
very uncomfortable and the room is bland, with greyish walls adding to the
feeling.  You hope your wait isn't too long.

Hospital Receptionist~
~
~
The receptionist sits here and has to make sure that your insurance
covers the treatment that the hospital will give you.  Often this takes
longer than the actual hospital visit.  The receptionist is very friendly
even though she has a very boring job.  You wonder how anyone could do this
for an extended period of time.

You can go in any of the four cardinal directions here.  This is a bad
spot to be standing, as doctors and nurses are running back and forth to
areas all over the hospital from here.  You get the feeling that they do not
welcome your presence here, but they do not really say anyhting to you,
other than the occassional dirty look when one of them bumps into you.

Hallway in the Hospital~

It is a sad sight and you hope this is a fate that doesnt befall you.

and surgeons walking back and forth, covered in blood.  There is a sense of
urgency in the air that is very tangible.  Looking to the east, you realize
that the emergency room entrance is directly ahead.

up, delivering dying patients to the hospital.  Four or five members of the
hospital staff wait for each one, getting briefed on the way to the
operating room.  The pace here is frantic, as every second counts.

brought from the ambulances.  Blood lines the hallway, and the patients
being carted by you on the gurneys are in very bad shape.  The medical staff
rushes by you into the room to the north.  Better stay out if you can't
handle the sight of blood.

Operating Room~

Blood is everywhere here.  The surgeons are covered head to foot with
protective gear, as are the nurses that assist them.  While they are the
best in the realms, even they cannot save everyone.  It is perhaps the most
difficult thing to accept --- that people are going to die, and there is
nothing you can do about it.  The only exit is to the south.

Methidoral City's Police force does as good a job as they are able to
against the war on crime in the city.  However, they are fighting a losing
battle, since the rising population, and thecriminals growing access to
powerful weapons, are starting to be more than they can handle on their own.
More officers are desperately needed, but few are interested in taking such
a dangerous job for so little money.

~

You are standing in a holding cell with various criminals awaiting trial
in the Methidoral City Courthouse.  Most of them are minor offenders, but
every once in a while there is a very dangerous criminal that has to be kept
in a cell by themselves.  Noone here seems to pay you any attention,
figuring you are just like them, awating trial.

are also understaffed, since it is all on a volunteer basis.  People in this
time are much too busy with everyday life to do something for free.

they cannot harm any of the others being held.  The man in here has a very
angry look on his face as he turns toward you.  It might be a good idea to
leave, before you find out why he is being kept by himself.

The Police Chief sits behind his desk, talking on the phone.  He motions
for you to sit down in a chair across the desk from him, but you politefully
decline.  It is a very nice office he has, with a solid oak carved desk and
fine upholstered chairs.  Various pictures and awards line the wall, and a
file cabinet in the back of the room contains all of the records, but it
would be a very unwise decision to try and go snooping through them. 
Esecially since he is still in the room.

The one sitting down seems very calm in asking the questions, but the
officer standing up is growing weary of his attitude and suddenly grabs him
by the shirt and demands answers.  The suspect appears startled and his
story starts falling apart after this.  The room is surrounded by tinted
glass, but you know the glass on the back wall is a one way mirror, with
officers sitting behind it observing what is going on inside the room.

drinks.  Walking past them, you enter a theater through the double doors and
are astounded to see a huge white screen hanging with pictures on it.  This
is something you have never seen before, and you are awestruck by it.
