A tiny trail of blood runs to the north, becoming more and more dense as the
footprints seem to blend together. Also, the once serene breeze has now
become a dark, dreary whisper.

noises come at you from each direction. The leaves on the ground might make
rustling sounds if they were not soaked down with blood. In each direction,
the forest appears to grow darker and darker.

river snakes its way thru the forest. The flow of the river seems to have 
picked up though in this narrow section of the river as you notice a small 
figure watching you from the northern shore. The river flows west and upstream
to the east.

Beside the Cottage~
You stand in front of a small cottage made of shabbily
connected boards and sticks, the kinds of things one might see
floating down a river. As you approached a noise came from 
within, and now all is quiet.  The entrance is to the west, or you
may return on the path to the south.

Inside the Cottage~
Around the room you can see a number of books and
flasks, perhaps used in the manufacture of magical potions. On
the far side of the room from where you stand the picture of a 
beautiful woman dressed in a formal gown can be seen. A door
leading outside is east of here.

A Beach~
You come to a narrow beach.  Vertical cliffs loom to the east and west,
and the harsh ocean is to the south.  To the north, you can see a less steep
mountain ahead, which you can probably climb.

Along the Beach~
You are walking along the beach.  Evidently, not many people travel on this rocky
shore, and you are lucky you found this place.  Continuing north is the foot
of a large mountain, while south of you, you can hear the roar of the waves
crashing against the rocky beach.  The vertical cliffs to the east and west
block any movement in those directions.

Foot of the Mountain~
You are at the foot of the mountain.  A narrow trail leads up the face
of the mountain to the north, while the beach leads back south toward the
ocean.  Vertical cliffs block all travel east and west.  It almost looks as if
stairs have been carved into the trail to the north.

Further up the Mountains Face~
Almost to the top, and the mountain face begins to get less sheer.  The
amount of remains scattered hasn't changed though, and you begin to wonder
if what lies behind that suspicious door in the side of the mountain might
not be the source of all these remains.

The Mountains Peak.~
At the top at last!  You can see almost everywhere from here, down to the
south is the dark forest, and further that direction lies Arnath.  To the
south east lies Bethaven, and the rest of that part of the lands.  To the
north lies a massive expanse of ice, beyond which you can not see.  Perhaps
this is one of the fabeled glaciers deposited here at the dawn of time.

Tiger Pit~
Remember the days when your mother told you to look both ways before crossing 
the street? Well the same thing goes for the jungle before you take a step in 
any direction. Now you didn't listen to your mother, and you didn't use any 
common sense. You're here in a pit with tigers, who are licking thief lips 
and thinking of you as kitty bits.
