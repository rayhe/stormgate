Nowex~
Nowex~
Nowex stands guard in the Northwestern Tower.
~
This guard leans against the wall of the tower.  The armor does not
appear to fit him as well as it should.  He leans against the wall with his
powerful gaze out the window.  He rarely moves while standing at his post
but every so often he'll slightly move the position of his battlehammer on
his shoulder.

Neeran~
Neeran~
Neeran stands guard in the Northeastern Tower.
~
The guard before you is much taller than most of the other minotaurs. 
His horns would scrap across the top of the tower if he were to stand on his
toes.  He leans on his battlehammer while standing in the center of the
tower.  His large brown eyes are able to pick out the tiniest detail from a
distance.  If anything were to happen to the city, he looks capable of
defending the village.  He keeps in large, metallic armor in pristine
condition.  The battlehammer in his hand is large enough to cleanly knock
off a head or two.  Clearly, this is a minotaur that isn't to be messed
with.

This minotaur is not as large as most of his brethen.  He stands a few
feet shorter than the average minotaur.  His body is covered in light
leather clothing.  A long quivver hangs down his left leg, and the quivver
is filled with many arrows.  His bow is slung over his back.

Sowet~
Sowet stands guard in the Southwestern Tower.
~
Sowet is wearing standard battlearmor.  The metal plates klank against
each other with her every movement.  The thick metal slows movement a little
but stops many would-be fatal blows.  Her hair is flung between her horns
and falls down the middle of her back.  A pink flower is placed in her hair
near one of her horns.

with such large horns.

Top of a Guard Tower~
~

An open trapdoor is in the center of the floor here at the top of the
tower.  A wood ladder reaches up into the tower.  On each side of the tower
are openings used by the guards to look over the village and surrounding
area.  A table and two chairs sits to the side of one of these openings. 
The chairs look worn from constant use from the guards.  The view out on of
the openings is spectacular as one can see far in all directions.

The guard wall rises up into the sky across the dirt path from a
residental area.  The stomping of guard boots mixes in with the sound of
children.  The kids play in the grass lawns of the houses.  After many years
of use, the dirt path has compacted into a hard surface.  The children seem
to be cautious to even approach the path.

A dirt path makes its way around the village at the base of the guard
wall.  The constant stomping of boots can be heard from the top of the wall.
The only other evidence of the guards is their shadows that can sometimes be
seen on the ground.  Across the dirt path from the wall is a building with a
lavish decor.  The windows are darkly tinted so it is impossible to see what
is inside.

into being only dirt.  Not a single blade of grass grows on this path
anymore.  The building to the south looks to be one of importance from its
decorations.  The window in this part of the building is slightly held ajar

Dirt Path~

The path heads toward the village center to the west and towards the
outer wall to the east.  An elderly woman sits in a rockhing chair outside
one of the houses.  She quietly quilts while rocking back and forth in the
chair.  A door squeaks as a slight breeze blows by.

The sounds of commerce can be heard to the west.  The dirt path is extremely
worn down at this intersection so this must be a popular intersection.  The
ground is hard beneath the feet as you travel along the path.  A minotaur
child darts around the corner causing many people to bump into each other.

buildings surrounding the path have been polished to a fine finish.  There

Small Pool of Blood~

Many layers of shelves line the walls of this room.  Vials and several
kinds of other containers currently are stored on these shelves.  The
contents of these containers are a mystery as most of them are not
transparent.  The bubbling of a pool in the room's center interupts the
silence periodically.  The pool is filled with boiling blood, and some blood
spurts over the sides from some of the bursting bubbles.

leather above the candleholder shows sign of once absorbing smoke.

be one of the most ancient.

Cavern Path~
~
~
The wall of rock has taken a break here.  A section of rock has been
replaced with a thick sheet of glass.  The glass is warped so that it is
difficult to see what is on the other side.  The glass is the same perfect
condition as the rocky walls of the city.  There is not a single scratch on
the sheet of glass.

Cavern Path~
~
~
The cavern reaches up into the darkness hiding the ceiling.  The western
side of the cavern continues to move to the west and east.  A path coming
from the inner reaches of the city intersects with the outer path.  A sense
of dread comes from the lack of sound coming from any direction.

Cavern Path~
~
~
The building to the north reaches high up into the mountain darkness. 
The top is beyond mortal vision but one can notice that the stone comes
together forming a spire.  There seems to something attached halfway up the
spire.  Across the path from this building is the outer wall of the city.

Cavern Path~
~

The path around the outer reaches of the city continue to the east and
west.  A large building to the north reaches toward the top of the cavern. 
After reaching to extreme heights, the building begins to converge into a
spire.  A large symbol is attached to the spire about halfway up.

Cavern Path~
~
~
The edge of the cavern is to the south.  The stone goes up beyond mortal
vision.  The shiny nature of the ancient rock warps the shadows into
lifelike creations.  There must be magic at work here because it is
practically impossible to hear anything beyond your reach.

Cavern Path~
~
~
The path curves around the southeastern corner of Anxi.  The height of
the cavern is undetectable from this point.  The rock seems to keep
traveling on up to the heavens.  The curve of the path is a perfect
semicircle without any deviations.  The rock is smooth to the touch and does
not show any signs of time.
