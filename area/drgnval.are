Her tender skin does not bare any marks of violence...speaking of skin,
you just realize that this lady is totally nude...

fashions.

An Overlook~
~
~
You are at the entrance to a large and wonderous valley that stretches from
here to the north.
Seated on a rock nearby, you notice Theodor, the famous Dragon researcher!
He smiles at you friendly and asks you to have a chat with him. He gives 
you many tips about the Dragons and mentions that he has placed Runestones
all over the valley to guide adventurers like yourself.
There is a Runestone here!

runestone~
Welcome to the Dragon Valley! This area is mostly for higher 
level characters, but there are some low level mobs as well.
The Area is listed as Level 25 - 100.
 
Most of this area is no recall except for specifically marked rooms.
Make sure to read all the other Runestones along the way, for they
will give you much insight in the secrets of the Dragon Valley.
 
Enjoy, Nosferatu!

The road descends rather steeply now. To the north you can see a golden 
gate sparkle in the sun. Did you remember to take the key from Theodor's
chalice? It seems you will need it soon.
Near the road is a small clear mountain lake. Many colourful birds roams the
clear skies.
There is another Runestone next to the road!

The road is blocked to the north by a huge gate made from pure gold resting
on two great stone pillars. The gate is locked tightly and any attempt to
break it down would appear to be futile. Fortunately, you remember the golden
key that Theodor gave you and unlock the World of Great Dragons!
Another Runestone is placed next to the gate.

bird...  Or is it a dragon?

rocks with some strong acid. 
Nearby, you notice and old and rusty grate on the ground. It appears to be
locked tightly. Another Runestone stands here as well.

west. East of here, the landscape seems to glow in an azure colour while to
the west all things are covered with some disgusting yellow slime.
A large, dragonshaped fountain marks this small square. The water from it
is fresh and clear...and you feel very thirsty all of a sudden.

You have come to yet another intersection.  One path leads off to the
east into something that could be best described as a swamp hole, while to
the west the land and trees are covered with snow and ice.  A chilling
breeze blows from that direction clearing the air from the swamp gas that
drifts from the east.  Nearby, you notice a large hole in the ground.  It is
covered with a strong lit that shines in all the colours of the rainbow!

Preparing for the Great Tests~

You have reached the northern end of the Dragon Vale. A huge door is 
blocking your way into the mountain caverns north of you. Nearby stands a
giant tree, almost as high as the surrounding mountains. West of here,
you can see a barren path...the wind carries the sweet smell for decaying 
flesh from that direction.
Next to the door, you notice another Runestone...

In order to reach the famed shops of the land of the Dragons, you must
first pass through a series of tests.  The first one, which you are facing,
is a very large and very nasty viper.  Even as you try to sneak past it, it
rears up in preparation to strike.

litter the ground.

mamba, all of the riches of the Dragon lands will be at your feet.  Passing
the mamba will be no small feat, however.  The immense size of the snake
sends quivers through your legs.  Incensed by the interruption into its pit,
it strikes out toward you.

the incredible size of the royal lair.

vaulted high in the air, and the stone seems to be granite.  Carvings of
Dragons roasting entire villages of people are carved into the walls, a
sight that makes you uncomfortable even though aggressions between mortals
and Dragons is long in the past.

~
~
The lair of the dragon prince is opulent.  Large piles of jewels and
coins lie strewn about him, and some of the jewels can be seen encrusting
his body.  Apparently, the many years of sitting on the jewels caused them
to become a part of his skin.  He looks like he would be a formidable enemy
despite the years of apparent laziness.  The stench of dragon and the acrid
scent of smoke fill your nostrils.

The Way Out...~

You have discovered the way out of the tests.  The dragons, knowing that
foolish mortals will often attempt to gain entrance into their domain, have
offered a way out other than death.  Not the incredibly cold-hearted beasts
that most people believe they are, the dragons are actually very
compassionate.  The only request they make of the mortals is that they be
left in peace.  Knowing this won't happen, though, they devised the tests to
keep them out.  They also have employed the assistance of Garby to tend the
wounds of the mortals lucky enough to escape the trials.

roof of the rock tunnel must be at least 20 meters in the air, and they are
purposefully left in their rough state to show off the many quartz crystals
hanging from them.

gold lying strewn about on the floor.  For a second, you almost consider
taking some of the bounty of this room.  Another look at the King changes

A Small Intersection~
~

You have reached a small interection. This area is void of any life signs.
From a cavern, positioned slighly below the place you are standing now, a
horrible stench arises! To the north leads a small small trail up into the
impressive mountain range that marks the northern border of the Dragon Vale.

Thin Trail to the Dragon Valley~

You are on a small mountain trail. You must be at least 4000 meters above
sea level now. The air is fresh and clean, but the elevation makes breathing
rather difficult. The trail seems to desend rather steeply to the south, 
while it is winding even higher to north.

The Dragon Gym~
~
~
Every imaginable exercise machine can be seen here in the Dragon Gym.  In
order to support the immense weight of the Dragon bodies, the wing
musculature has to be very strong.  The exercise machines have been
specially designed to pinpoint the major muscle groups involved in flying.

A Torched Slope~
~
~
This slope looks as if a major forest fire has hit it.  The few trees
that are still living are torched on the tops, and many of the trees have
been reduced to charcoal.  Soot and the stench of burning fills the area. 
You wonder what could have possibly caused this massive destruction.

Before a Smoldering Cave~
~
~
The cause of the desctruction of the lands below is now apparent.  You
stand before a smoldering cave.  The heat is so intense even out here that
you almost pass out.  Inside, you can hear the low rumble of a Dragon
sleeping.  At least, you hope he's sleeping.

Lair of the Red Dragon~
~
~
As you enter the Red Dragon's Lair, you immediately see your mistake. 
Not only is the Red Dragon not asleep, he's actually sitting at the entrance
of his lair waiting for something to roast.  The quick look you get at him
reveals a marvelous set of flame-red scales.  Smoke billows out of his
nostrils, and he moves to attack.

An Acid-Pitted Slope~
~
~
The black gooey masses of what used to be trees and animals lie spread
out in waste over this slope.  The acrid stench and the caustic result of
breathing the air into your lungs makes you question the sanity of being
here.  Not only is it hazardous to your health, you might also run into the
cause of this devastation.

lungs, and a sour taste is in your mouth.  The desolation and destruction
around you is complete.  From within the cave, you think you can hear the
deep rumbling breathing of a Dragon.

As you walk in the entrance to the lair, you realize you should have
waited for an invitation from the Green Dragon Lady.  Her scales are
magnificent, and her breath is deadly.  Clouds of smoking acid billow out of
her mouth and nostrils, and you marvel at this feat.  You don't marvel long
because she begins her attack.

in.  A splendid looking blue dragon raises its graceful head and peers at
you intently, then blinks.  Prepared for an all-out battle, you are
surprised when she opens her mouth and greets you happily.  After talking
with her for a day and a half, though, you think maybe death would have been
better.

realm.  The floor, instead of being covered with gems and gold, is actually
covered in ice.  Ici can be seen slipping and sliding on his talons back and
forth over the floor, chasing a little black ball with a stick.  It is no
wonder that the other Dragons have locked him up here...  Ici is a lunatic!

Although the idea of a frost dragon or a fire dragon does not surprise you,
you had no idea that there could also be a slime dragon.  You are just about
to laugh when a large and slimey head rears up from the floor.  After one
piercing and furious gaze at you, the Yellow Dragon opens its mouth to
attack.

brush surrounding the swamp.

and you chop it in half just in the nick of time.

slides of his scales as he rises up out of the hole to tower over you. 
Puffs of thick, acrid smoke come out of his nostrils, and his eyes burn with
an unholy fire.  He seems to be the most incredibly cruel Dragon you have
ever met.

she considers attacking you.  She must not find you worth her while,
however, for she does not attack.  It might be a good idea to get out of
here before she changes her mind, though.

She seems pleased to see you however, and offers you a seat in a beautiful

color of gemstone, and the rainbow colors are magnificent.
