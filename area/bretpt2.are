say Greetings.  This area will be different in some ways
say than other areas.  Interractivity between you and the
say mobs.  Most mobs in this area will respond when you
say say 'hello' or 'hi'.  After that, you will see his
say response, and you can continue the conversation through
say keyword conversation.  Lets try an example, say 'hi'
say or 'hello'.
~
>speech_prog hi hello~
say Hello there!  I am a helper!
say In that sentence, the keyword would be 'helper', so
say say that in response.
~
>speech_prog helper~
say Very good!  Most of the mobs in this area work in
say this way.  They will respond to 'hi' or 'hello', and
say will also respond to 'bye'.  I hope this helps you!
~
>speech_prog bye~
say That's right, you remembered.  Should you need help
say again, then just re-enter this room to start the
say help over.  Have a pleasant journey!

You are walking along a forest path.  The trees stand tall around you, as
far as you can see.  A little ways to the north you can see a town.  This
must have been the town that you have heard so much about.

You are walking along main street.  A rather rowdy pub is to the east of here,
while a forest is too the south.  The town opens up to the north.  A newly
added bank is to the west.  It seems as though this place is not as untouched
as you thought.

You are in a rather loud tavern.  A huge bar extends the entire east wall,
while Raymond continuously cleans.  An archway exits the bar to the west,
and the walls are covered in paintings.  You stop to take a glance, and
realize they are paintings of this very bar.  It gives a rather odd look
to the place.

place.

priest is usually here to heal your wounds, and to help train your skills.
The stained glass windows on the south wall are not striking in any way, and
the hardwood floors are not polished.  This church has seen some rough times

any longer.  The path travels north, to the base of an array of mountains, and
south, deeper into the swamp.

You are walking along the northern edge of a rather large hill.  The trees are
much denser to the east and north of here, and a path follows the edge of
the forest in both directions.  The path also travels to the west.  Small bits
of sand and pebbles blow around at your feet.

You have come across a swamp.  The ground seems to be holding for the time

out to the west, the trees in that area decayed or decaying, while a much
