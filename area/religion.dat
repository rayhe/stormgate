Truth, Honour and Chivalry~
Templar~
In the ancient past, shortly after Starbirth, the Gods created the world
we now know as StormGate.  They populated the lands with creatures
reflecting their own likenesses and traits.  Caradoc, the father of Truth,
Honour, and Chivalry, had a fondness with the people that followed in his
light.  He blessed certain leaders with near godlike abilities so that they
may act for him in this world.  During the Second War of Might, Caradoc
sacrificed his immortality and position on the pantheon to bring an end to
the destruction.  With his dying breath he gave one of his favourites,
Templar Lohengrin--a name that embodies the elements of the religion--his
powers and ascension to the pantheon of the Gods.  Now, under Templar's
leadership and the example of Caradoc, the followers of Truth, Honour, and
Chivalry have become a tightly bound legion of might bent on subduing the
corruption that plagues StormGate.

Law, Order and Justice~
Vanceril~
In the realm known as Stormgate, walked a mortal priest named Vanceril. 
The realm was filled with chaos, confusion, disorder and lawlessness. 
Unhappy with the state of the realm, he vowed to rid the world of these
evils.  At first he was highly successful until a band of warriors known by
some as the Dark Brotherhood, plotted to kill Vanceril.  As he returned to
his home, he was attacked and left for dead.  His actions were not left
unnoticed, though.  The gods took pity, realizing the realm needed balance. 
They sent the Holy Knight, Abalane, who cut his own hand and poured his
blood into the mouth of Vanceril, thus consecrating him into the realm of
immortality, and as the representative of the good of the land.  As Vanceril
awoke, he gazed upon Abalane, who wore platinum armor, and silver swords. 
Looking into the eyes of Abalane, he realized his destiny.  Abalane then
disappeared leaving his armor and swords behind.  Vanceril then started the
Temple of Swords, and the religion now known as Law, Order, and Justice,
which seeks the most pure of heart, mind, and soul, among the followers. 
Only a handful of these followers will be chosen to complete the Temple of
Swords.  When the temple is complete, Abalane will return and reveal the
powers necessary to conquer the evils of the realm, which will be passed on,
through Vanceril, to only the most pure followers of Law, Order, and
Justice.

Life and Nature~
Eden~
When the world of StormGate came into existance, the mortals of the land
cried to the Gods to give them guidance.  Hearing the calls of the land and
those who were bound to it, the essence of Life and Nature formed and
created one who would protect and care for her children.  Eden smiled and
the trees and land changed, shaping itself to form a temple and haven for
those who would assist in the care of life.  Many beastmasters, druids and
rangers made pilgrimage to this sacred place and swore their allegiance to
this new deity and began a crusade against the unnatural plague of the
undead and those who would abuse the land.  It is the belief of these
followers that without the life of the flora and fauna, the land itself will
wither and crumble to nothing.

Lies, Manipulation and Deceit~
Betrug~
Survived to live another day.  Many believe that the truth shall open the
way to a better existance.  It is the deception and manipulation of those
delusional creatures that will allow one to grow stronger.  My survival over
all time proves that the beliefs held by the many are false.  All you know
is false.  Truth and honor are concepts that change over time, but deception
will always live on.  Only those who follow the path of the chameleon shall
survive all that stands before them.
