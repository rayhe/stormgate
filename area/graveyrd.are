Stan~
Stan~
Stan the undertaker is looking for some corpses to bury.
~
Stan is an interesting man in his early 40's.  He is not particularly
handsome at first glance, but there is something that draws you to him. 
Maybe it's his soft dark eyes, or possibly the intonation of his voice. 
More likely, however, it is a concoction of pheremones he collected from
various dead insects.  He reminds you somewhat of a biology professor, and
you can imagine him out in the field collecting insects and putting them in
dead jars.  The mud on his boots and the stench of the grave betray his
occupation, however.  Stan is an undertaker, and he loves his work..

On a windswept hill~
~
~
You are standing on a wind-swept knoll overlooking a desolate land.  In
the distance you can see the hilly tussocks which cover the graves of people
long dead.  A sudden flash of lightning brightens the sky like the noonday
sun.  The resounding clap of thunder sends chills down your spine.

Path to the tombstones~
~

The long and dusty path to the cemetary is enclosed tightly on each edge
by tall skeletal trees.  Flaming red eyes peer out at you from a hollow in a
tree and are quickly gone.  The distant howl of wolves makes you question
the wisdom of coming here.

As you walk down the cemetary path, you get the strange feeling that you
are being watched.  Looking over your shoulder, you see nothing, but you
cannot shake the feeling, nonetheless.  A tree that has bent over in the
wind seems to claw at your garments like a great outstretched hand.

The path continues on to the north here and begins to climb up a small
hill.  The continual crashes of lightning overhead make you nervous.  Just a
little distance up ahead, a lightning bolt crashes into a dead tree, sending
pieces of wood flying all over the place.

The path which is winding up a hill, turns to the east here.  The dust
from the path clings to you clothes like the stench of death to a grave.  A
cold wind whips leaves around you in a small funnel.  The distant sound of
wolves on a hunt make you hustle your steps.

You have reached the top of the hill.  Looking down to the north, you can
see the outlines of the many tombstones which fill this ancient graveyard. 
Large drops of rain are now falling on your head, and the mansion in the
distance, although scary-looking, might afford some protection from the
elements.

To the north, you can see the beginning of the graveyard.  It is a
veritable maze here in the darkness, and you wonder if you will be able to
make it through.  The mansion, which is barely discernable above the tall
grave markers, lies to the north.

Beginning of the maze~
~
~
You are at the beginning of a maze of tombstones.  Without the proper
guidance, you don't think you will ever make it out.  A flash of lightning
illuminates the area, and you think you can discern something moving between
the tombstones.

You are wandering aimlessly in a maze of tombstones.  The ground is very
uneven here, and you trip and stumble often.  There seems to be no method to
the tombstones; they are laid out will-nilly all over the place.  Hopefully,
you know which way you are going.

End of the maze~

Finally, you have reached the end of the tombstones.  Just up ahead to
the north, the ancient and decrepit mansion looms above you.  The windows
are shuttered, and an old door hangs in the doorway.  Terrible noises which
might be caused by the wind can be heard around the perimeter of the
building as well as inside it.

When the dust settles down, you see an old bedroom.  A huge canopy bed which
used to be white stands in the middle of the room.  Lying on the bed is a
skeleton with long hair.  Upon closer inspection, you realize a knife is
stuck through the ribcage.  Around the skeleton are heavy brown stains.

been left vacant over a very short period of time, and many valuables have
been left behind.

painting.  An old vanity stands against the eastern wall, with jewelry and
makeup vials still standing on it as if to be used.  Apparently, the owner
was planning to come back at some point.

Bedroom~
~
~
The northwest corner of this room is equally peculiar.  Not a speck of
dust can be seen in this room.  In fact, it looks like it is recently lived
in.  A comb and a basin of water stand on a table here.

Bedroom~
~
~
The carpeting in this room is in good condition.  Plush and of a very
elaborate design, it looks like it was installed yesterday.  The wallpaper,
too, is in very good condition, and not a single piece is faded.  It is
almost as if someone was living here.  But that couldn't be possible, could
it?

Bedroom~
~
~
A large four post bed is standing here in the corner of the room. 
Curtains run along all sides of it, forming an enclosed bed.  Afraid of what
you will find, you pull back the curtains, exposing a freshly made bed.  You
breathe a sigh of relief, but you can't help being a little nervous still. 
Where is the inhabitant of this room, and why is he living here?

Bedroom~
~
~
A painting of a young and beautiful woman hangs in the corner here.  Her
long blonde hair cascades over her pale white shoulders, and her soft ruby
lips give you a sensuous smile.  She is wearing a soft rose gown, and the
soft curves of the material accuentuate the curves of her body.  On a table
beneath the picture, a single fresh red rose lies.  An unexplainable chill
runs up and down your spine.

Under the staircase~
~
~
A staircase rises up into the darkness of the attic above you.  You have
the feeling that you are very close to your goal, intangible though it is. 
The pounding of your heart in your chest echos in your ears as you place
your foot on the first step.  It's now or never...

Hallway~
~
~
To the north, east, and west, solid wooden doors are closed.  The eastern
and western doors are unlocked, but you can't seem to budge the northern
one.  You try to peek through the northern door's keyhole, but you cannot
see anything in the pitch darkness.

Hallway~

You are at the intersection of two hallways.  Lamps with glass chimneys
are fastened to the wall, and blackened smoke stains can be seen on the
walls.  A long and fancy rug runs the length of the north-south hallway, and
there are footprints in the dust going south.

Hallway~

The footsteps turn to the west here and enter a room which is barred by a
door.  The handle turns freely, however, and you brace yourself for what
might be inside.  Another door can be seen to the east and is also barred by
a plain wooden door.

Hallway~

The hallway ends here and is decorated by a small half-circle table and a
few paintings on the wall.  Some rats scurry across your feet and run down
the hallway.  The plaster on the walls is cracking, and it crumbles at your
touch.

The hallway ubruptly ends here.  A painting of some flowers in a vase is
set into a gilt frame on the wall.  A long a jagged rip in the painting
attests to the abuse it has received by the many haunts.  Unable to bear the
thought of fresh, alive flowers, they have destroyed the painting.

guess that the door to the east is just a closet.  You might find a clue to
the owner of the house, however.

over your feet, and the chewed up remains of a fur coat brush against your

closet.  You go to investigate and find..

In the attic~

Old boxes and packages fill this corner of the attic.  Broken windows
give you a view of the surrounding area outside the mansion.  The storm has
not abated; instead it has gotten more furious.  The wind smashes a tree
branch against the building, making a tapping sound.

Sanctuary of the madman~
~
~
As you move into this area from behind a stack of boxes, a man turns
furiously on you.  As he turns, he reveals a corpse wearing a long, flowing
wedding dress.  She is laid out on a table as if sleeping, but her badly
decomposed body tells you that she's no sleeping beauty that will wake up
with a kiss.  A dark stain over her left breast gives you just a hint of
what is going on here.  The madman sees your glance and begins to rant at
you ...

You stand at the top of the stairs which lead down to the second level of

items which have been packed away for future use.  From the looks of the
rest of the mansion, however, there was not much of a future for anyone
here.

More items are in storage here.  A box of old toys, a baby carriage, and
other child-related items are in this section of the attic.  Because none of
the rooms in the mansion were decorated for a child, you infer that these
toys were packed away long before the house was deserted.
