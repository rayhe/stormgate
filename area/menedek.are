The marble path of Laclede Street continues to the north and south.  The
wall to the east stands high above the city.  A couple guards can be seen
walking along the top of the wall.  This city must be well protected with
the guards as well as the marble wall.  The citizens of this city do not
seem to realize the work put into keeping them so safe.

slabs look quite worn from the constant traffic.  People all around stop to
talk amongst themselves.  The high walls which guard the northern and
western borders are constructed from the finest marble.  The walls stand at
least the height of ten humans.

The path of Barthes Street continues towards the east and west.  Movement
is slow but continous as people weave in and out of each other.  The
conversations of travelers can be heard as they pass by but fade away as
quickly as they came.  A large and thick marble wall blocks the north from
attack.  Along the southern side of the street is a line of houses. 
Children toss a small ball around in the front yard.

to shield their eyes from the sun.  An elderly halfling is walking up to one

buildings all appear to be houses for a variety of races.  One door is
decorated in the rich and beautiful art of the Western Elves.  Others show
the metalwork of dwarves, the bonework of ogres and trolls, and the work of
many other races.

invaders.  Several posters advertising upcoming events hangs on the wall.  A
group of three children jump up and down at the poster of an upcoming
concert.  The poster is of a group called, Light Winds, which will play the
city in the coming weeks.

is a collection of aromas.  The smells of freshly baked goods, smoke, and
sweat bombard your nose as you look at the surrounding scenes.  A bumbling
magician stands against the city wall performing simple tricks for meager
coins.  Lindell Boulevard goes north and south while Taklas Street goes off

stands perfectly still and does not react to any of the distractions around
him.  You can't make out what is through the gate.

River of Blood~
~
~
The obsidian has given away to regular, cold rock.  There is a glint of
obsidian from above but none down here.  The rock has formed into a small
ledge that hangs out over a river.  The river is flowing with a red liquid. 
Upon closer inspection, the red liquid is really blood.  A river of blood
flows beneath the caves of obsidian.  The river flows evenly without
anything stopping its travel.  There is a pole attached to the end of the
ledge.  It appears that a boat was tied here at one time.

The hallway of obsidian turns to the east and south.  Several torches
flicker along the walls.  The light glints off the obsidian used in the
construction of the Keep.  A set of stairs climbs up into another level of
the Keep.  Screams of pain followed by laughter booms out from the second
floor.  The crisp noise of new magic echos through the halls.

splattered over most of the hall.  The blood is still thick and fresh as it
slowly crawls down the wall.  Small chuncks of bone lie stuck in the flow of
blood.  There are dried blood spots all over the walls as well.  The stench
is testing your tolerance as this place must be like this all the time.

Before the Flaming Emblem~
~

Two hallways come to an intersection before two large doors.  The two
doors are made from pure bone and stand between you and the throne room.  An
emblem has been engraved into the bone and set on fire.  The flames make it
extremely hot as you stand before the doors.  The hallway goes off to the
east, south, and west.

~

The throne room of the Obsidian Keep stretches far back underneath the
arches above you.  A throne constructed from bone rests against the back
wall.  Two skulls are at the front of the armrests.  The eye sockets emit a
dark, red glow that appears to follow your every move.  Slaves are chained
against the walls with large obsidian clamps placed over their mouths. 
Small tubes and nozzles stick out of the slaves as the tubes drain their
blood.  The blood flows into two large pools with one on each side of the
room.  The lives of these poor souls is slowly being poured into these pools
of blood.

break off in the four cardinal directions.  The screams of death bombard you
from each hallway.  A bone ladder is attached to the corner of two walls. 
The ladder goes up through a small opening in the ceiling.  Puffs of smoke
filter through the opening every so often.  The only light is coming from
this opening.
