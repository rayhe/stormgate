AErathi Desert~
~
~
You are walking along the southern end of the AErathi desert.  You can see some
kind of structure to the west.  You take a look to the south, and see nothing
but sand as far as the horizon, so you see no point of going in that direction.
The only exits are west and north.

You are walking along a desert path.  It is much hotter to the south than it
is to the north.  Small bits of sand are starting to seep through the cracks
in your armour, while some other particles get up into your face.  You find
it rather annoying.

Desert Path~
~
~
You are walking along a desert path.  A large forest can be seen a little ways
to the north, beyond a T-Junction, while a large desert can be seen to the
south.  The vegetation in this area is dying rapidly, due to the heat coming
from the desert.  You can't help but feel a little sorry for the plants, for
weather does not care what it affects.
