The sands of the Naratian desert blow in the winds as you look across the
horizon.  To the east there is nothing, save sand and what remains of the
old Naratian road.  Once a well used commercial vessle, the forbidding
environment of the Naratian dessert has all but ceased trading along this
route.

The road continues to the east and west, though you can't see any signs of

To the east you notice something you hadn't seen in quite some time... 
Signs of life.  In the distance, to the east, you think you can make out the
form of a cart at the side of the road.  Something about it isn't quite
right however.  The cart seems to be overturned and as you strain your eyes
to discover more you wonder if indeed you have stumbled accross another
sentient being.  In all directions the desert stretches on towards the
horrizon.

You arrive at the wreck of a small cart.  It's obvious that whoever was
the unfortunate soul who crashed here won't be making his deliveries as
planned.  The cart overturned on the young man and it's weight, it would
seem, was enough to crush his spine.  You look around for signs of the horse
which must have pulled the cart, but from the amount of decay on the corpse
of the young man you guess that it must be long gone.

anyone's guess, but what ever they are, they must have been here a long time
judging by the enormity of the dunes.

The old Naratian road runs through the desert from which it takes it's
name.  Once a major trading route the increasingly forbidding environment of
the Naratian Desert has caused merchants to all but abandon it.  As the dry
heat becomes more and more oppressive you begin to understand why.  In the
distance to the east you can make out the peaks of some castle or fortress. 
In all other directions you see nothing but sand stretching towards the
horrizon.

The stone work of the old Naratian Road, which once stretched all the way
from StoneGate castle to Methidoral remains intact here.  Your footing is
sure, and though the road is lightly covered in sand, walking is far easier
on this than it would be if there were nothing beneath the sand.  To the
east StoneGate castle rises out of the desert, a lonely monument standing
against the sands of time.

You stand in the shadow of the magnificant castle StoneGate, it's
magnificant black walls rising towards the eerie violet sky.  The lands
surrounding it are strangly lush and green.  It is an oasis in the desert. 
The old Naratian road ends at the edge of StoneGate Castle's elegant court
yard, it's stone work free of sand and debris and still in impecable shape. 
One is forced to wonder what powerful magics enchant this place.

Naratian Desert~

This part of the desert is not travelled often.  There are no apparent
tracks to follow and no signs of life for miles to come.  You shield your
body from the suns relentless rays of heat and the sand that blows in the
dry winds.  Tucking under your cloak you move on.

You scramble to the top of the sand dune to peer around.  You can make
out the road to the south, nothing for any other direction.  The wind picks
up speed and throws itself at you with a great deal of force.  You shield
your eyes from the sand and make your way through the desert again.

swelter of the desert sun is draining the strength from your body.  Far to
the north you see a large mountain range rising out of the sands.  To the
west, the magnificant Mandrake Canyon continues to cut a swath through the
barren landscape.

You are confronted by three natural obstacles here.  The first is the
incredibly oppressive heat of the desert sun.  The second is the massive
Mandrake canyon which lies to the west.  The third is the rocky cliff to the
north.  Atop this impressive rock formation lies the central plains.  The
cliff face is sheer however, and the driving winds prevent all but low
flights.  If you want to reach the plains, you'll have to find another
route.

You are standing in the middle of a great desert.  But you find comfort
in the fact that to the south is a great pyramid.  Maybe they might have
some water for you.

You continue your trek across the Naration Desert, silently hoping that
you will soon find some clue as to a way out of this place.  You begin to
wonder if there is actually a way out at all, if so, will you find it?  You
have been travelling for what seems like an eternity.  Your supplies are
dwindling and it just keeps getting hotter!  If only you hadn't have left
the road.

You trip over something solid and fall on your face.  You roll to your back
and prop yourself up to see what it was.  A piece of pottery?  How peculiar.

Way off to the north you can now make out the cliffs that the Central
Plains lie upon.  With your bearings now, you know the orad is due south. 
Do you dare head back to the road and risk getting lost again?  Or do you
head north and leave this desert through the plains?

You come over the top of the sand dune you've been climbing, and much to
your surprise the most wonderful sight is right in front of you!  Palm trees
everywhere!  Lights!  Water!  Dancing hula girls!  You've made it out!  It
is then, in the hieght of your excitement, you notice you can see through
all of these things slightly.  A mirage?  Awww man!  Just when you thought
you made it.

become unbearably heavy, your clothes have become soaked with sweat and your
eyes blinded by the sand.

Silently you make your way through the swirling winds that bombard you
with the coarse desert sand, never looking back, always looking to what
comes ahead.  It almost seems how life should be.  Like this desert, your
life has been filled with painful and hopeless situations.  Like you have
made it through life thus far, you have traversed to the reaches of this
desert.  You continue onwards.

sound of running water which must be the reason for the life in these trees.
Some chirping can be heard coming from a nest in the branches hanging above.
The power and life radiating from these trees is immense.  One can just sit
and wonder how much these have trees have seen over thousands of years.

in the ground are all thats left from the constant trampling.  To the south,
one can hear the voices and sounds of the city.  The pollution from the
nearby city has started to take it's toll on these first few trees.

A small breeze filters through the trees around you.  The soft cracking
of branches can be heard from everywhere.  A family of small rabbits hop
across your path into the bushes.  A sweet aroma is coming off the little
purple flowers growing off some bushes.  The leaves crunch as you crush them
with your every footstep.

The small path has been cluttered with falling leaves.  Small branches
from the smaller trees brush against your clothing as you walk around.  The
bushes covered with purple flowers continue to grow here.  The bushes seem
to originate from a large patch of them growing at the base of a mountain. 
The mountain does not seem to span very high into the sky but looks
impossible to cross at this point.

A large group of trees seem to be huddled around a small pond.  This pond
must be what is keeping the wildlife alive in this part of the forest. 
Along the side of the pond is a squirrel quenching it's thirst.  The trees
growing along the side of the small pond appear to be much healthier than
the rest of the plant life.  The swaying of the branches breaks the silence
of the forest.

The trees in this part of the forest do not seem to grow within five feet
of the mountain.  All that lies between the trees and the mountain is dirt. 
As one looks up at the top branches, you can see that even the branches are
leaning towards the west.  The wind seems to be coming from the east but
does not seem to be strong enough to cause this.

them.  The sight of squirrels and other wildlife can be seen throughout the
trees and along the ground.  From behind a bush slightly off to the side,
one can smell the droppings of passing animals.

A rocky path leads off to the east towards a mountain.  The trees have

instead of leaves as one moves closer to the mountain.  There appears to be
a path leading into a mountain pass to the east.

grass immediately surrounding the campfire is trampled and brown.  Small
logs have been dragged from the forest to surround the rocks making room for
one to sit.

to stop and turn around at the base.  There seems to be one single bush
growing against the mountain.

above even the tallest trees of this forest.  A hole has been dug into the
ground.  A small underground stream flows underneath the forest.  This must
be how the trees and bushes stay so green and healthy.  This must be a
popular watering hole from the markings around the hole.

Several trees have grown apart from the rest.  There appears to be three
of them that have wrapped around each other.  This has caused many of the
larger branches to grow towards the ground.  It appears that one could use
these branches to walk higher into the tree.  Many squirrels seem to be
running up and down these branches.

mountain.  A small stream flows slowly at your feet.  This water has caused
the surrounding ground to become mud and you can see that several paw tracks
have been left behind.  Many trees have several of their roots reaching for
the water of the stream.

on the clovers.  The branches sway slightly with the breeze.

There seems to be a mixture of life and decay in this area of the forest.
The trees and bushes to the south appear to be falling over and dying.  As
one looks north, the life of the forest appears to be better off then their
southern counterparts.  One can slightly hear the sounds of civilization off
the wind coming in from the south.

The crossing of branches has made it hard for more than one person to
stand here with comfort.  From the top of the trees, one can skim the tops
of the forest.  There is a mountain to the west but one can't see if there
is a path through from up here.  One can see the tops of buildings from the
city far to the south.

fragrance.

This seems to be the perfect place for a picnic.  You sit down against a
large tree to the north, which bars your path.  A small squirrel
investigates you from a distance, and shows particular interest in the food
you are carrying.  As it nears you, you offer it a cracker, which it eats
happily.  It carries some of the food with it, perhaps for its family.

towering gracefully over the other trees.  A tree here you look at has a
hole the size of your fist in it.  Peering inside you see a nest of newly
hatched birds.  They screech for their mother as you look inside.  You see
the mother swoop beside your head with a worm into the hole, and it gawks at
you for disturbing its children.

living in its branches and a ant colony in its roots.

where it drips.

wildlife from around the area drink, oblivious to your presence.

by a weapon of sorts.  You walk toward it, and it attempts to stand up with
little success.  As you get closer, you see the wound was made recently, and
you wonder if you are not alone in this forest.  Coming within three feet of
the young doe, with a final burst of strength it stands up and walks off,
limping.

This area of forest seems to be the habitat of a small animal.  The
animal isn't here now, but an obvious bed of leaves and the reminants of a
meal lay on the ground.  Bushes with very sharp thorns lie to the south, and
you don't dare venture into them.  The nest lies under them, safe from
predators.

You hear the voices of men to the south.  Looking in the air, you see a
pillar of smoke towering in the sky above.  There is a camp there, and a
small bonfire is blazing.  Animals stray from this area of high activity.

You can almost feel the sweat evaporate off your skin.  A large chipmunk

A dark shadow stretches from the trees throughout the forest.  The light
seems to be unable to pentrate the darkness.  As you peer into the darkness
around you, you think you notice movement but it never seems to stay still.

A firepit has been dug into the ground in the middle of a small clearing.
A few rocks have been lined up around the pit to keep the fire from
escaping.  You notice an old bent and rusty shovel tossed to the side.  It
must have been destroyed while digging the hole in this ground.

This area of the forest is suprisingly beautiful, and it causes you to
daydream of what forces made such a sight.  You can imagine some creator
scurrying across the land, molding things as it goes, creating and sculping
with a mere thought.  It is a female doing this work, which is evident in
the soft leaves, the gentle whisper of the wind across your body, and the
sweet smell that permeates your every breath.  (BTW, this was my last
overworld room, and being sick to death of it I let Manaux do it.  -Myria)

A Buzzing Swamp~
~

The water is up to your chest and the mud is making it very hard to
move.  With each step your feet fall further into it and when you pull one
foot out, the other sinks in more.  The slime is everywhere and its
impossible to avoid it, and most of your body is covered in green.

Here an old dock stands, with but one boat.  Its owner is offering travel
to a new land, and the offer is tempting.  The waves beat the boat fiercly,

A large hole into the rock signifies the north as being an entrance to a
cave.  Judging by the size of this mountain, this could be the one and only
Tricorn Cave.  The cave told in all those children's fairytales and myths. 
Surprisingly enough, it exists, but what about that monster that is said to
live inside the cave?

centuries by nature, and their mystery reflects the status on this Tricorn
Cave.  Cold Air emits from the north, showing a potential sign of this being

Berry bushes have grown in a tight line along the east and south.  All
the bushes are growing a lushish blueberry.  A nice blue shade is reflected
onto the ground from the sunlight hitting the berries.  A few animals come
by to pick some berries every so often.

The Dihrin Forest~

A large semicircle of trees prohibits travel to the south.  The branches
have grown to an enormous size and cross over each other many times.  A
couple benches have been carved out of rock and left sitting underneath. 
The tracks around the benches tell of many travelers that have stopped at
these benches.

Trees of various sorts rise around you, towering high into the sky and
preventing the light of the sun from touching your face.  The trees and
shrubery around you is so dense, you can only wonder what might be hidden
in this place.  For the most part, it's relatively quiet around you,
only the sound of birds chirping really, and leaves rustling in the wind.

There is a forest off to the west of you, one filled with many trees
of all sorts, small animals that run about, and occaisional groves
for the traveller to rest within. And from here you may also go onto
a new path. The choice is yours, as always.

A Dense Forest~
~
~
There is nothing much around you that is visible beyond the multitude
of trees that grow all around you.  They grow to great heights, many
going so far up, you don't think your eyes even come close to reaching
the tips.  The ground is a soft cushion of earth beneath your feet. Moss
and soil living is harmony.

~

There is a small cluster of flowers growing between the roots of an
oak tree here.  You're not familiar with what type of flower they are,
but there is quite the variety of colour among them.  A woodpecker pecks
at the trunk of a tree somewhere in the area...making quite the racket.

deep into the earth.  The air is clear, fresh, purified by the work
of the multitude of trees around you.

A Pool of Water~
~

A pool of water, upon which floats numerous leaves is deep into the
earth, it's depth seemingly out of place for so small a pool.  No stream
seems to feed it, to give it life.  It has a life of it's own, for it's
unatural for a pool of water so small to stick around.

A Fallen Giant~
~
~
A giant of a tree lies fallen here, moss covering it's now dead trunk.
Insects aplenty move about it's surface, boring holes into the dead
matter, making homes.  Animals rest in the hollow inside, finding a
temporary respite from hungry predators who would have otherwise caught
them in the open forest.  This tree was old, it survived much that
others never even witnesses, but now it is dead, and no one mourns it's
passing.

nothing but leaves.  They are so dense that the sun cannot possibly
penetrate their shield to get to you.  They rustle softly in a breeze,
laughing quietly.

A Break in the Canopy~
~

You can stand in light if it is your desire here, a small shaft of light
streams down from above, a break in the dense grouping of leaves above
allowing for the sun's rays to shine in. Illuminating the forest floor,
all the insects, plants and what not that are alive on it's surface.

A rotting carcass lies here.  Insects crawl around it's corpse, feeding
off the decaying matter.  There are things in life that some would wish
never to witness.  Then again, there are some who might want to see
this in all it's glory, those who study the art of necromancy for
example.

Deep Within the Forest~
~
~
The forest stretches out all around you.  Twigs and dead leaves litter
the ground, their strength too feeble to hold onto the tree when a 
wind swept through the forest, and so the life that held them to the
tree was torn from them, and they fell slowly to the ground, exhausted,
and finally at rest.

A Rune Covered Rock~
~
~
The forest surrounds you still, but here lies a large, flat rock buried
deep into the ground.  It's surface is covered in strange runes of a
civilisation long dead.  They enjoyed their time of supremecy within
the forest, and when the time came, they yielded to those who came after
them, giving the forest over to a new group of beings who would care
for it.

~
~
Towering trees grow all around you, blocking out the suns light with
hundreds, thousands of leaves that rustle softly in a gentle breeze
as it blows by, caressing them. The simple sounds of chirping birds
and the shifting leaves are all that great your ears.  There is not
much else to listen to save yourself.

Thorns all about~
~
~
Vines lace the forest floor here. They zigzag this way and that, going
here and there, mindless in the patterns of their growth, but they are
thick and tough and covered in thorns.  Sharp piercing thorns that could
tear flesh and draw blood in a second, perhaps that is their purpose.

A Small Dip in the Forest Floor~
~
~
You enter a sort of valley, the ground slowly slopes downwards gently
to a level center, pass that, it creeps up slowly again till it's even
again.  It's almost uncanny the precision of it.  Perfect in the angles
and slope all the way around.  Of course many trees grow within this
little depression.  These seem to be larger than the others, they sore
higher than those around them.

The Forest~
~
~
A small rivulet of water flows past your feet, it is perhaps a foot
wide.  In it are carried small bits of debris, little twigs, small leaves,
small little things like such.  This little stream will likely dry up
in a day or two, and you will likely be the only person who will remember
it, and if you don't, in essence, it shall truly be dead.

A Tangle of Roots~
~

Two rather massive trees grow beside each other here.  Their roots also
grow here...And that has made for quite the mess. They intertwine, each
searching for fertile soil that the other hasn't already used, it's a
battle for life, slow and nearly invisible.

You find it easy to think clearly here, in the silence that surrounds

moving in the wind and the little noises that you yourself make.  This
is truly a peaceful place where silence seems to reign.

The Forest~
~

A world of trees.  No houses, no people save travellers.  This is a
place where people just don't decide to live. Do they fear the untamed
wilds. Do they fear having to live alone, left to their own skills and
intelligence in order to survive.  Do they fear that they lack the skill
and intelligence required? Or do they simply fear being alone.

A Symbol in Bark~
~
~
A large tree grows here, towering high, high into the air.  You look
at it and you can sense that it's age must be incalculable.  You also
see when you look at it, that the surface of it's trunk has been marred.
Here and there are symbols carved into the bark. A heart with two letters
here, two letters overlapping each other over there, a myriad of them
all over, each symbolizing and remembering the love of those who put them
there so long ago, or so recently.

A Pond Within the Woods~
~
~
A small pond is here, filled with a somewhat brackish water that seems
to suit such animals as frogs and turtles, who seem to enjoy it well
enough.  Lilypads cover the pond, giving the frogs and other such animals
someplace to goto for shade when the sun does on occasion shine through
the trees.

You are deep within the forest, there really is little remarkable around

opportunity to kill them.

look at it from a tree's span of life.  There is much that this tiny
little thing will witness if it is to live out it's life to the length
it could.

The woods~

You are within the forest.  Trees surround you, the sky is pretty much
completely hidden from view by the myriad leaves that adorn the many
trees.  Silence permeates the area.

A Big Slab of Granite~
~

A big slab of granite rock rises up from the earth, on it are scrawled
a few words, carved by a bored adventurer, or a lost traveller, or maybe
by a forlorn lover, seeking that which he or she truly desired.

An ominous shadow rises to the east of you, towering high, high above

You can't see much of it though, the leaves still being thick above
you, blocking out a great deal.

Where did that come from? Why is it here? What is it's purpose?
And such can be good.

The edge of the Mountain~

You are at the edge of the foothills of a rather large mountain to the
southeast of you.  It rises high, high into the sky.  High enough in
fact that to you it seems to pierce the gray clouds overhead.  South
of the small trail that leads south past the mountain, you can see forest
which is much more dense than that which surrounds you.

covered rocks, animals, birds, plants. Everything in life that's natural
and beautiful, in all it's innocence.

Within the Forest~
~
~
Through the dense foliage, you can watch the clouds pass you by slowly
in the blue sky. They are of the nice white fluffy kind, the kind that
children look up at, and imagine that they are something other than
clouds.  Ah, sweet innocence.

The Bottom of a Cliff~
~
~
The forest tends to die off here, as it goes further towards the east.
The very high cliff that you come up against tends to block out a great
deal of sunlight, so not many trees are able to grow in that area.

The Foot of an enormous Mountain~
~
~
You stand in the shadow of a mountain that overshadows the forest in
which you have been walking.  It's impressive in size, and you're not
sure, but you think you've maybe heard it's name somewhere before, was
it perhaps Mount Heaven?

The forest~
~

A leaf falls down on you, it's tenuous grasp to the branch above you
broken, perhaps by a passing wind, or perhaps simply by lack of strength.
It falls past you to the ground below, where it shall decompose and be
used to nourish other trees so that they might grow other leaves.

Corner of the Cliff Face~

You stand at a sharp edge of the cliff face. It almost seems to have
been cut rather than eroded.  You can follow the cliff face to the north

to the west or south.

lazily over it's summit.  The east holds a bountiful forest, where you
can see healthy trees and hear the sounds of wild animals.

Surrounded by trees, you see a sign that tells you someone has passed
through this place before.  The burnt ashes, the remains of a once proud
campfire are gathered in a pile on the ground.  The grass is trampled
down from booted feet passing over it often.

You're at the bass of a very high cliff that rises up into the sky on

notice no handholds that could really give you any purchase. Climbing
this cliff would be a foolhardy venture doomed to failure.

A Small Rivulet~
~

You follow a branch as it is swept by in a little rivulet of water
that's maybe a foot or two wide.  It's speed is far from rapid, but
it's odd for so small a body of water to sustain itself and to exist
for as long as the marks of erosion suggest that this one has existed.

There is much hidden from sight when walking in the woods.  The trees

The trees are beginning to grow closer and closer together to the west. 
The intertwining of the branches makes it impossible to travel any further
to the west.  Off to the east, one can hear the sound of water rushing up
onto the ground.

The path between the trees gets harder to travel upon.  Many fallen
branches have started to collect on the ground.  Snaps and cracking can be
heard beneath your every step.  A large stump has been knocked over, and it
is making travel through the forest more difficult.  A small nest can be
seen sticking out one side of the stump.

The trees start to line the edge of Lake Vohan.  A thick eerie mist
covers the lake from view.  The water quietly laps up against the trees
along the lake.  In the dirt, one can see the markings of small animals. 
From the amount of footprints, this must be a popular spot amoung the
wildlife.

The forest begins to thicken to the west.  A small family of squirrels
travels through the trees.  Some fallen leaves make the ground much softer
than before.  A small breeze makes the branches shake up against each other
causing a small amount to fall to the ground.  The sunlight reflects
brightly off the leaves covering the ground.

The trees open up into a small clearing.  The grass is neatly kept and
has a nice shade of green.  A small blue pond of water is in the middle of
the clearing.  A log has been rolled up next to the pond where it appears
many travelers have rested.

The mist covering the lake has intruded upon the land.  This mist is
making it hard to make out what is at your feet.  Several trees are letting
their roots soak in the edge of the lake.  Lake Vohan stretches further to
the north and south.  From the west, one can hear the sounds of birds siging
from the treetops.

have piled on top of each other to the west.  A skunk can be seen sticking
his tiny head out of one of the fallen trunks.

You stand on the banks of Lake Vohan.  A heavy mist blocks any vision of
the middle of the lake.  The trees have stopped short of the lake by a few
feet.  There is plenty of space for one to just rest against the lake shore.
Some leaves form a slight covering over the ground.

taken root in the shallow waters.  The branches of these trees reach high
and far as they stretch out in all directions.  A small amount of shade is
under a couple of the trees giving protection from the sun.

A piece of land stretches into the waters of Lake Vohan.  This part of
Vespen Woods has been stripped of all life.  Only dirt covers the ground at
your feet.  As one moves closer to the lake, the dirt only turns into mud. 
The mist covering Lake Vohan is as thick here as ever and one can't make out
what is across the lake.

The soft snow continues to slowly float down from the sky.  The light
reflects off each snowflake as it makes it's way to the ground.  It appears
to be like hundreds of little prisms falling from the sky at once.  The
breeze of this plain spreads the snow out evenly over the ground.

A gust of wind lifts some of the top snow up and blows it around.  It

each flake.  The wind blows on through and the snow gentily falls back down
to the ground.

Snowflakes float down from the sky and land all around you.  One lands on

single drop of water drips down to the ground.  Just then a sudden gust of
wind comes flying by and your nose now has a bit of ice on it.

Even after hundreds of footsteps in the snow, you have yet to hit the
ground.  This plain is currently covered by several feet of snow.  It must
have been falling for ages to accumulate to such heights.  The snow falls
continuely but not hard at all.

A thick blanket of pure white snow covers the ground keeping it safe from
harm.  It must have taken decades for this much snow to collect over the
plain.  Only a soft, lazy breeze sweeps over the plains which is just enough
to keep the snow from gathering on your shoulders.

You grow cold to the bone as you continue your trek through the snow. 
The brisk wind whips across your face causing your lips to grow dry and
crack and the warm blood that emerges grows cold in seconds.  Each step you
take is more difficult than the previous and the only thing that keeps you
going is the fact that if you stop to rest you might freeze to death...

The wind has blown lots of snow into a massive pile to the south.  You
try to take a step in order to climb but each time your foot sinks a couple
feet in the snow.  You are just going to have to move in another direction. 
The snowy plain expands off farther in the east, west, and north.

mountains rests nuzzled in the field of snow.

You continue your trek through the snow occaisionally drinking warm

for warmth.  The cold wind continues to blow and your clothing has become
wet and damp on the outer layers.  All around you all that you see is snow
and the moutains to the west.

Mountain Cave~

For a moment you feel at ease as the wind and constant snowfall cease as
you find shelter in a small cave.  It might be a good place to rest of camp
for the night if you feel you can brave the extreme tempratures.  Upon
further exploration of the cave you see an exit to the right which leads to
more of the treacherous mountains.

You stop to look around at your surroundings at this point.  You notice
that you have only been climbing through the base of the mountains and have
not actually reached the mountains themselves.  Nevertheless you are pretty
high above the snowy plains now and from here the elevation rises even more.

Ice has formed over top the snow at this point making it somewhat easier
to walk through yet alot colder.  You cease to feel your toes any longer as
the cold settles into your boots freezing your feet.  The same goes for your
fingers which are pale and purple from the bitter cold weather.

Your difficult journey through the mountains has brought you this far but
can you go much further without proper shelter and clothing?  These things
as well as the thought of freezing to death race through your mind as you
watch even more snow fall around you.  Many times you have narrowly escaped
falling icicles and you wonder when your luck will run out.

A Prairie Road~
~
~
You follow the well traveled road through the Maiwon plains which leads
to the docks to the north.  Even from here you can smell the sea, and hear
the soothing crash of it's tide.  The prairie grasses are thinning here and
the soil becomming more sandy.  With the sun shining brightly overhead this
would be a particularly scerene location save for the bustling sounds of the
merchants unloading their vessles in the distance.

The waves lap gently against the shore here.  Ahead of you to the north
the docks stretch on for what seems like miles.  All along their length men
and women scramble to unload their valuable cargos from their holds.  At the
far north end faries wait to take you to Bretonnia.  To the south the great
Maiwon Plains stretch off into the distance.

The docks seem to stretch on forever.  All along them merchant vessles

them.  The smell of sea salt drifts into your nostrils as does the smell of
the workers.  Off in the distance to the north you can see the faries
waiting patiently in port for fares.

upon it during thunderstorms.  You continue your trek.

The Base of a Cliff~

You are at the base of a huge cliff.  The stench of a swamp can be
smelled all around you, its scent almost overwhelming your senses.  You can
go back up the cliff, or further into the swamp.

The path has nearly turned into beautiful forest.  Large trees cover the
area, and the sound of life is everywhere.  Birds dart from tree to tree
while squirrels scuttle around in search of nuts.  The lake and cliff both
end a little ways farther, and the stillness of the path has now ended as
well.

An eagle dives by your head, barely missing.  It screams and flies off,
its powerful wings creating a forceful blast of wind about you.  It's call
echoes loudly, fading out after a few seconds, and the new ripples formed on
the surface of the lake collide with the old ones in perfect
synchronization.

soaked.  A large tree juts out of the cliff face in the wrong direction, a
pile of dead leaves is under it on the ground.  It looks very strange.

The path curves here, widening a few feet, then nearly closing up at the
corner of the cliff.  A few trees block your path, forcing you into the
freezing water.  While wincing and forcing your feet to move, a bird lands
on one of the trees and begins singing, as if mocking you.

Several trees are clustered together here, around a large bush. 
Everywhere around you, you see small birds nesting and screeching.  Several
dive at you from the tops of trees and fly back before you can reach them. 
After doing this for a few seconds, they all hide and quiet down to silence.

A huge dragonfly whizzes by your ear, deafening you for a few seconds. 
It circles and snatches something tiny a few feet behind you.  Its wings
seem painted, and it seems too big to be real.  It hovers for a moment and
flies off the way it came.

You hear a loud crack as a few trees coming out of the cliff face
collapse under the weight of a few large chunks of earth.  Large rocks begin
falling down the cliff, nearly blocking your path, and when several smaller
pieces hit you, they dissolve into fine powder instead of cracking your
skull open, the dust effectively blinding you.  The world becomes a gray
brown.

The lake's deep blue has shifted into a pale green, allowing you to view
some of the life beneath the surface.  The amount of life living in these
freezing waters is astounding.  Large red fish slowly coast around schools
of striped violet.  Bright green fans sway back and forth with the current,
and small black dots flash around them.  A few birds dive into the water,
the immeasurable source of food never ending.

The rhythmic ripples of the lake have stopped; the water is now slightly
translucent.  Every few seconds, a flash of color appears and disappears
just as quickly.  Birds glide above diving down every few seconds but flying
up before reaching the water-the fish not visible enough to catch.

The sound of a pair of crickets in nearly perfect harmony is unnerving,
as it is the only sound you can hear.  Two trees on each side of the path
sway towards and away from each other, their leaves making no sound though
it seems they should.  The crickets continue their song.

Walking by the lake, a small gray fish jumps out of the water several
feet and lands with a small splash.  It disappears immediately, the only
proof of its existance is the new set of circular ripples from where it came
and went.  A rock falls from the cliff.

is mind numbing.

feet, hard to maintain steady footing, always about you is the dark and
sinister threat of falling, this rocky floor would not offer a comfortable

It was likely caused thousands of years ago, perhaps an earthquake,
or maybe expanding water into ice was it's cause.  It exists, why question
it's existance, or strive to give answers to it's birth?

Birdsong floats softly on the currents of air coming from the south, where
they sit in groups in the many branches of the many trees.  They chirp
without purpose, they have little to worry about, little to fear.  They
live with nature, not against it.  They have adapted and so are well
suited to that forested world.  The birds occaisionally take flight, but
they always avoid the mountain that looms to the north of your current
position.  Whether they fear it, or perhaps in some way respect it, you
cannot decipher.

You may perhaps realize that there are enough leaves above you, hanging
from the many, many trees, that if they all decided to fall at this moment,
you would quite easily be buried.  Giants and dragons would be less likely
to suffer such a fate, but they would most certainly be covered in a
spattering of leaves.  The weight of which, on a wet day, would be most
impressive to say the least.

The dark shadow of a mountain can be sighted to the north of where you

point in your field of vision, to which your eyes are almost always
drawn to without hesitation.  Unconsciously, you wish to make sure that
it still lies as before, that it hasn't gotten up and moved while you
had looked away.  But it's a mountain, there is no need to display such
fears, so you don't, and simply check up on it once in a while.

~
~
There are numerous different types of trees surrounding you that grow
to heights the likes of which you've seldom witnessed.  The sweet smell
of the earth flows up from beneath you, clear and strong in the fresh
air that permeates throughout the forest.

A simple pool of water~
~
~
A small pool of slighty muddy water fills a little hole in the ground
here.  A couple of small animals scurry away as you approach, not willing
to find out too late whether or not you be friend or foe.  The water
ripples as for some of them, the quickest path is that through the pool.

In the cool shade of the trees~
~
~
The trees many leaves protect you from the baleful gaze of the sun.
Whilst you walk within this forest, seldom shall that great orb in the
sky have an oppurnity to touch your skin, to singe and burn it without
regard to you.  Mind you, who's to say that other dangers don't lurk
within these darkened woods.

The Woods~
~
~
There is about you a number or large oak trees, all of which seem to have
seen better days.  Here and there along the lenght of their trunk you
can spot holes that have been bored through the bark into the wood that
lies beneath.  It would appear that there is a large number of woodpeckers
in the area that have taken a liking to this particular area of the woods.

The Shadow in the Rocks~
~
~
A large group of rocks bursts forth from the soft earth.  You can tell
that they are indeed old.  Moss covers almost every square inch of their
surface and they have been worn nearly totally smooth, few indeed are
the edges that remain jagged and sharp.  Rising up into the air, they
prevent the growth of trees in this section of the woods, and so you
can clearly see the sky above, in which white clouds pass you by.

A Feast of Sorts~
~
~
There lies on the ground a log of unusual diameter, it being nearly as
wide as it a grown human tall.  Mosses and lichens grow all about it,
and you can see thousands of insects walking along its surface, plodding
slowing from one place to another, seeking the bounty of nourishment
that adorns this dead tree.

A Simple Stream~
~
~
A small stream carries with its gentle current little bits of wood, some
leaves and little else.  However, it does beyond that seem to be fairly
clear, you most certainly if you so wished could drink from it without
any worry of it doing you damage.  The water is actually very pure and
clean. Animals along its banks drink from it, raising their heads on
occaision, feeling instinctively that you watch them.

In the depths of the forest~
~
~
As you are in a forest, you find yourself surrounded by trees.  Small
trees, large trees, stunted trees, dying trees, even trees that resemble
people you may have met.  Though anyone who resembles a tree is rather
odd and I wonder why you might be hanging around with such a person.

The Woods~
~
~
An odd looking rose bush stands alone here, there isn't another form
of vegetation within ten yards around it.  You look closely at it, and
you can see that it's thorns are tinged a light red, similar to that
of blood.  You would almost think that perhaps this thing is carnivorous,
but it doesn't bother you as you pass it by, though you think just maybe,
maybe you did see it move out of the corner of your eye.

The Scent of Nature~
~
~
Ah, the beautiful smell of flowers and the other pleasant smells of nature
has been rudely interrupted by the stench of feces, and an awful lot of
it.  You see the pile in a little clearing, and you wonder if perhaps
a dragon or some other enormous creature had the sudden impulse to relieve
him or herself of an unpleasant burden.

Animal Dens~
~
~
You have come across a couple of small holes that have been burrowed deep
into the ground.  They must serve as homes for some forest creature, most
likely a rabbit, but there are certainly other animals who live in such
dens.  There is to the north more forest, to which there doesn't seem to
be an end, in fact, all directions hold the same destiny from what you can
see at the moment.

The Cold Embrace of the Earth~
~
~
A most unusual sight greets you as you enter this part of the forest.  You
will likely never see anything quite like this.  Before you is a large
mound of rock.  Encased within the rock, you can see bones protruding..
You recognize the bones as those of a dragon, and from their size, you
would be able to safely estimate that it was a large dragon.

You are fairly deep within the forest.  You have seen little besides
trees for quite some time now.  Well, there are the occaisional group
of large rocks, or stone formations bursting through the ground, to rise
into the canopy of the trees that surround them.

In Shadow~

There is actually no actual sunlight penetrating the dense canopy that
unfolds above you.  The foilage makes sure that the sun doesn't leave
your skin brazen and burnt.  It's protecting you.  Of course, it could
also be protecting the low flying dragons that fly above it, searching
for a meal.

and in some cases, raucous, horrible, noise.

bare with the exception of a large rock which would make for a comfortable
place to sit for a humonoid type creature, were one wont to do so.  But
then, such races are impractical, and do things that you would not expect
or even find remotely logical.

walk about, feeling the cool breeze sweep through their soft fur.  Birds
float on the currents of air that rustle the leaves on the trees around
you.  And flowers bloom all over the place, the sweet fragance filling
the forest with a pleasant aroma.

The Woods~

The trees about you climb high into the blue sky, which you really can't
see, but you may always assume is still there.  The dense foiliage of
the trees prevents the sun to pass very far through the leaves.  You
get nothing but light which has passed through the photoreceptors of the
greedy leaves.

Within the Woods~

There are about you thousands of trees, making up a large forest in which
you've been travelling for a while.  A gentle breeze caresses you, cooling
the surface of your skin, making sure that the heat doesn't get to you too
much.  But perhaps it is the heat you seek, for some prefer the boiling
sun to the cold and dark depths of a forest.

The Forest~

A large mound of earth rises here, at its crest, a large slab of granite
breaks through the ground, rising skyward in the hope perhaps of salvation,
though what salvation a rock needs is questionable to say the least.
From atop the rock, you figure a most beautiful dawn you would be able
to behold in the morning, when the suns first rays touch down on this
section of the earth.

An interesting tree~
~
~
There is a tree before you here.  You think that perhaps the best adjective
that you could use to describe it is...odd.  Its basic shape is that of
the letter 'Y', and as the branches extend upwards, more and more of
these 'Y's form and branch off.  But the other thing to note about this
rather peculiar tree is the fact that it is for all purposes, mostly
two dimensional.  The branches don't branch out in all directions, they
branch out as if there was only the two dimensions to grow..

foolish enough to go rouse the bees from their sleep, and bring forth
their rage upon you?

A few nice flowers grow on the ground, carefully and away from the path
of humans and their type.  They grow because that is their nature, they
are very pretty, and remind you perhaps of a love who you haven't seen
in a long time.  Thinking about this person, you wish perhaps you had
given, or been given flowers such as these, to be shown, or to show the
depth of your affection.

a bit of substance, so that others might remember it.  A world of magic
is a world of unpredictable things, and things of wonder and amazement.
The bells could be anything, but you do not hear them anymore, they have
faded away, and you can, and in fact never could, really distinguish
from which direction the sound emmanated.

A Long Log~
~

A long log lies here, cut down long ago by who knows whom for who knows
what purpose.  But looking at it, you can see that its purpose has become
that of a resting place for travellers who have travelled through this
area.  The bark on its upper surface is worn from people sitting there,
playing in and about its dead branches.  Its time in the sun has long
since past, and it no longer enjoys life, but others enjoy it in its
fallen company.

The Protection of a Leaf~
~
~
Above you hang hundreds of thousands of leaves, suspended on thousands
of branches attached to hundreds of trees.  You can see that a leaf does
not offer the best of protection to things harmful.  Sure they work well
enough when it's raining or when it's windy, but let's say acid started
to fall from the sky.  Would not the acid eat through the leaves and get
to the soft tender flesh that sought to hide beneath anyway? Or would
they be able to stop a meteor from crashing and crushing those who walked
beneath the green canopy? Think about it...and watch your step with much
care.  Or else.

To your north, there is a lake.  Looking at it though leaves you somewhat
dubious as to how safe travel across this body of water is.  You can't

mist which doesn't allow you to see the center.  Memory stirs, and you
think perhaps you've heard of such a lake, and it's name was Lake Vohan.

smaller from a distance.  Just east you can wade into the lake and bathe in
the shallow water if you like.

Near the Lake~
~
~
Just west lies a meadow lake from which a mist drifts ever so slowly
along.  You walk through the meadow so far has been very pleasant and
eventless.  Wildflowers grow in abundance and are slightly wet with dew.  To
the east the meadow continues.

In the Meadow~
~
~
As you travel through the meadow you find that there are plenty of
natural provisions provided for you.  Berry bushes and edible plants grow
all over the fields and not far to the west is a lake where you may refresh
yourself with water.  Not far to the east you can see a forest.

Between Wood and Meadow~
~
~
Just north lies a vast forest known as Vespen Wood.  From here you can
smell a sweet smell that seems to come from the direction of the woods.  You
wonder what you might find if you explore the woods or what dangers might
lie ahead.

The Forest Dark~
~
~
You have wandered from the beautiful meadows into a dark and foreboding
forrest.  You notice that something is not quite right with the forest, as
you hear nothing but the sound of your feet crushing old leaves and branches
beneath you.  Where have all the animals gone?

You are wandering through a dark forest.  Your footsteps are all that you

The Forest Dark~

Briers, and vines grow along the ground making walking at times very
painful and hazerdous.  Most of them have died and have beome dried out and
hardened making them all the more dangerous.  As you look down to examine
the scratches and scrapes that these dead things have inflicted on your
skin, you notice a group of strange and disgusting insects trying to make
thier way into your shoes and up your leg!

be.  It looks like some kind of dried fruit or seed.  Covered in pointy
spines, it almost looks like a pinecone, but not any pinecone that you have
ever seen.

A large, dark, murky swamp lies to the south of here.  You can feel the
ground soft underfoot.  Small trees dot the landscape, stunted by the
stagnant water.  To the east a large mountain bellows smoke from its

creatures.  Several large hawks fly above, looking down upon the plains for

ominous black mountain in the NorthEast.  It belches smoke and ash

You find yourself on the Western edge of the Meitsu plains, blocked by a
small flowing creek.  The plains spread out to the East and South, while the

The Meitsu Plains~

The plains come to an abrupt end here, as they are taken over to the
North and East by a stagnant swamp.  The grass is dying here, as the
poisonous water seeps through the ground and kills the life before it claims
the land.

short way to the south.  Small leeches horde around here, waiting for
animals to come drink the stagnant water so that they may drink their blood.

to look at you for a moment and then continues to do its work obviously
deciding that you pose no threat to it.

The rocky path proceeds to the north and south.  The snow is constantly
being blown on top of any mark that you put into the snow.  It always
appears that not a soul has moved across this path.

The wind is picking up in strength and making travel much more difficult.
You stare out into the swirling mass of snow but can't make out anything. 
All that is in front of you are miles of frozen artic lands.

You feel the need to proceed a little slower.  You just felt ice under
your feet on that last step.  You don't want to move too fast and risk
falling down in this cold.  The snow seems to cover all traces of movement
as soon as you move a step.

around you at tremendous speeds.  The snow feels as if it is biting at you
as it is thrown into you face by the wind.  The path moves off to the north,
east, and west.

While you walk you take the time to fully observe the beauty of the wood.
The trees here are well-nourished with leaves of all shades of green.  They
form a canopy above the path allowing only tiny bars of sunlight to break
through, giving the area a green-tinted luminescence.  Suddenly realizing
that you've stopped walking to admire, you hastily carry on your way.

It seems as though if it's not one thing, it's another.  The cool lake
breeze may have taken the heat from the air, but now the path is becoming
overgrown with bushes and vines growing into it and roots protruding from
the dirt.  You carefully attempt to navigate around the obstacles with
relatively little success, rubbing the spots on your body that are sore from
falling.

Mountain Path~
~

The small path comes to a halt at the base of a steep cliff.  Small
pebbles rain down from high above every few minutes.  There are some larger
rocks sticking out from the mountain.  These rocks give just enough hold to

Mountain Path~
~
~
A small path through the mountain continues its way to the north and
south.  The rocks surrounding the path have been worn down into nice round
structures from the passage of time.  Even the path is really smooth and

Mountain Path~
~
~
The mountain path takes a drastic turn to the north and east.  A large
boulder has falleen down the mountain side stopping here.  As one looks up
at the mountain, it is impossible to see the top.  You wonder how far this
rock must have fallen.

Mountain Path~

~
The path through the mountain sweeps off to the west and south.  The path
starts to become steeper as you make your way.  A couple rocks tumble down
the mountain into a pile slightly off the path.  The mountain seems to be
devoid of all life at this particular spot.

Continuing Along the Forest Path~
~

You follow the path eastward.  It still consists of flat, hard-packed
dirt with few stones or ridges which you are thankful for.  The forest is
becoming denser now, but is still light compared to the thick foliage you
see ahead.

The Black Boar Tavern~
~
~
You are in a small tavern constructed of wood and stone.  Hunting
trophies line the walls, while a giant fireplace provides warmth and light,
filling the air with smoke.  The Black Boar seems to be popular with the
hunters and farmers who live in the surrounding area, as well as the
occasional traveller, and you feel strangely comfortable in the bucolic
surroundings.  The only visible exit is to the south, through the door you
entered from.

You have entered the large common room of the legendary tavern, the Horn
and Pheasant.  The room is packed with patrons, mostly travellers and local
farmers, and the smell of sizzling beef wafts in from the kitchen to the
west.  A small staircase leads upstairs, while to the east is a door leading
to the stables.

Inside the Small Inn~
~

This small inn doesn't seem to get many visitors.  Constructed of aged
wooden planks caulked with tar, there are only a few patrons in here.  The
wind batters vainly at a small glass window, and a cheery fire burns in the
hearth.  A small stairway behind the bar leads up to the second floor, but
the sleeping innkeeper blocks the way.

This room takes up all of the inn's second floor, and contains several
wooden cots lined against the wall.  Some are already occupied, but there
are a few free.  Strangely enough you suddenly feel extremely tired, and the
cots don't look too uncomfortable...

You have entered an old inn built against the forest path.  At the moment
the inn is not particularly busy; only a few travellers sit at the tables,
nursing their drinks, while an old farmer sits before the fire, silently
musing.  You feel at peace here, and think that maybe you should stop your
journey for a bit to relax and refresh yourself.

escapes through a hole in the ceiling.  The smell of fish is very strong

Inside an Abandoned Cabin~
~

This cabin seems to have been abandoned years ago.  Despite it's lack of
care it seems to be in reasonably good shape.  And at least it lets you get
out of the snow, though it isn't any warmer inside here, making you eye the fireplace speculatively.  Perhaps you should start a fire.

from a wooden plank, and a sleeping pallet constructed from dried swamp
grass.  Not the loveliest of surroundings, but they seem to fit the hut's
inhabitant just fine...

You have entered a large hut, filled to overflowing with pieces of wood
of various size and quality.  Rusty sawblades are hung on hooks on the wall,
and the sole pieces of furniture are a huge wooden worktable and a sleeping
pallet.  To the east is a doorway leading outside.

The Woodpile~

You are surrounded by piles of logs, stacked precariously upon each

is that squeaking coming from...

Inside the Owl and Egret~
~
~
This large common room is sparsely populated; apparently these lands are
not well-travelled.  A roaring fire provides a cheerful counterpoint to the
damp cold outside.  The few patrons are quietly tending to their mugs of ale
as they stare into the fire.

In the Lodge~
~

While the wind shrieks outside in arctic fury, in here it's quite warm
and comfortable.  A huge, roaring fire is set in the brick hearth on the
eastern wall, and around it are wooden chairs.  Most of them seem to be
occupied by the hunters and trappers who move through the forest, as well as
an occasional traveller stopping for the night.  The lodge continues to the
south, while a wooden stairway leads up.

This section of the room is darker and quieter.  A huge pot of something

eat.  Ancient hunting traps line the walls, and an enormous stuffed boar
head glares out at you from a wooden plaque.

the worn set of stairs leads down to the first floor.

The Top of the Tower~

You have reached a chamber at the top of the ancient tower.  It appears
as if this place has been uninhabited for many a year; cobwebs and dust
cover every surface, and a nest in the stone rafters indicates that birds
have taken up residence here.  Empty stone shelves lay about, smashed and
cracked, and the remains of a huge stone table stand in the center of the
chamber; perhaps this was some spellcaster's laboratory.  In one corner is
an ancient brass mirror, too heavy to be carried off by looters.  The glass
shimmers strangely in the dim light.
