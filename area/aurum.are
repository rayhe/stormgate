The GateGuard of Aurum stands before the Golden Gates

Looking at her, you see a young woman with waist length black hair, a
pretty face, but eyes, eyes that are glowing pale white in the sockets.
Dressed in red robes with gold thread worked all over in patterns, you
feel that there is an aura of magic about her so strong that getting
too close to her makes you shiver.  She looks you over as you approach,
and you know that there is nothing that she didn't learn with that look.

Morla~
Morla~
Morla stands over a corpse, which she slowly returns to "life".
~
An old woman, she is stooped and ugly.  She sees the world through small
squinting gray eyes, looking out over a big nose.  She is far from the
beauty who tamed the beast in the stories.  She smells of rotting flesh,
and you can't help but wonder if it's from being around corpses..or if
it's just her.

The Poet~
A young elf stands here, smiling at all who come by.

This is the only person you've encountered here who isn't human that
you can tell belongs here.  He is dressed in white and gold and there
is about him an aura of peace and serenity that seems to try to work
at your heart.  Though his skin still seems young and full of health,
his hair is white and silver, suggesting that perhaps he isn't as young
as he first appears.

&CRoom Progs
 
&WRprogs are the for most part, something that will not be used
on a frequent basis, they are rare, unstable, and unpredictible
to a great degree.  Don't use them unless you have talked to Nexus
or Tyrion about them first please.  They are however, as follows:
 
&Yenter_prog:   It is triggered by someone entering the room.
cast_sn_prog: arg is slot number of spell that triggers it.
death_prog:   This prog is triggered by something dying in the room.
exit_prog:    Triggered by someone leaving the room.
sleep_prog:   Triggered by someone going to sleep in the room.
time_prog:    triggered when a certain time happens, uncertain of arg.
pass_prog:    Not sure, but maybe triggered by someone with passdoor on
wake_prog:    Triggered by someone waking up in the room.
rand_prog:    Happens at a random interval
cast_prog:    Triggered by anyone casting
rest_prog:    Triggered by someone resting in the room.
 
&WTo make a new rprog, the command is rpedit create.
To edit an existing prog, the command is rpedit #
To list the progs, and their numbers, the command is rplist
To remove a prog, the command is rpremove #

intro~
&CBasics
 
&WAll work done in a room editor is initiated by using the redit command.
Typing redit with nothing following it will put you in a editor for whatever
room you are in at the moment.  Typing redit Vnum will trans you to that
room and put you in the editor.  To create new rooms, redit create Vnum
is the command used.

&CRoom Editing
 
&WThis is the layout for a room editor, each field on the left, i.e. Name:
is a field, some of which you have the power to alter in a room editor.
You may alter the description of a room.  Typing desc will put you into a
text editor, for help on text editors, see section ********.
Fields in green can be altered:
 
&GDescription&W:
&GName&W:       The Golden Gates                Displays room name           
&YArea&W:          71 {  IMM } Aurum    All     Area#, Level Range, Area name, Builder.
&YVnum&W:       19901                           Vnum of Room.
&GSector&W:     inside                          Sector type.
&GRoom flags&W: no_shadow no_mob                All room flags
&YCharacters&W: nexus                           Characters and mobs in room.
&YObjects&W:    none                            Objects in room.
 
&WNote that everything in green is something you can change.
Characters and objects don't necessarily reflect which mobs
are reset in this room, only those which happen to be in the
room at the moment.  I'll talk about reseting objects and mobs
in rooms later.

&CSectors
 
&WThere are numerous sectors to choose from.  The purpose of the sector
field is to choose the type of terrain the characters walk on, the
sector type you choose determines how many movement points are taken
for each "step".  These are the sectors to choose from:
 
&Ginside             city               field              forest             
hills              mountain           swim               noswim             
underwater         air                desert             badland   
 
&WIt should perhaps be noted that if you give a room the 'air' flag,
the character will have to have fly/levitate in order to be able to move.
Also, if there is a room linked down, they will fall that way.
~

&CRoom Flags
 
&WThe purpose of room flags is to give certain properties to the room. I
will attempt to explain the effect of each one.
 
&Gdark:              Will not be able to see anything unless equiped with a light.
private:           Only two people can be in the room at a time.
no_recall:         You may not recall from this room.
tele_area:         Does nothing apparent.
no_flee:           You will not be able to flee from this room when in combat.
smithy:            This room is treated a smithy to repair stuff.
no_shadow:         Characters may not target mobs in this room with shadow walk.
safe:              Combat cannot take place in this room.
cone_of_silence:   Characters in this room do not hear stuff.
tele_world:        Does nothing apparent.
silent:            You can not hear other channels in this room.
noscry:            Characters using scry will not be able to scry into the room.
no_mob:            Mobs will not walk into this room by chance.
solitary:          Only one person may be in the room at a time.
no_in:             Travel spells won't work to this room: i.e. Astral walk, portal etc.
no_magic:          No spells can be cast in this room.
bank:              This room is treated as a bank.
damage:            You will receive a small amount of damage every tick in this room.
indoors:           keeps weather and other such outdoors related messages from sight.
pet_shop:          This room is treated as a petshop.
no_out:            can't astral walk or portal etc from this room.
no_offensive:      can't initiate combat here.
nofloor:           Without fly or levitate, player will fall.
pkill:             Outdated, no longer has a use.
 
&WIn addition to the damage flag, you can set the amount
of damage that is applied each time.  The command for
this is &Yrdamage amount&W.
~
E

&CExit Flags
 
&WThere are numerous exit flags that you attach to exits.  They are listed below
with their effects.  The syntax for adding an exit flag is direction exit flag.
i.e. south closed  .  You may add more than one flag at a time,
i.e. south closed locked hidden  .  To save typing basically.
 
&Gdoor:       creates a door in the desired direction.
pickproof:  if the door is locked, it cannot be unlocked using pick lock skill.
hidden:     door is hidden, must have appropriate spell/skill or use search to find.
closed:     the door is closes when area resets, without, when opened stays open.
passproof:  spells that allow for passage through doors will have not work.
random:     Does nothing.
bashproof:  locked doors cannot be opened using bash door skill.
magiclock:  currently does nothing.  Intended for skill that was never made.

&CRoom Creation and Linking
 
&WOkay, I'm going to go through how you would go about building a
series of rooms and connecting them.  I will explain how to connect
them, disconnect them, and do it quick and easy.  Also how to make
locked doors and other such things.
First off, here are some commands that can be used in redit.
Preceed them with a direction. Eg:  North dig 4022
 
&Ydig vnum         - creates the room and makes a two way link
link room vnum   - make a two way link
room room vnum   - make a one way link (use with caution)
key object vnum  - makes specified object the vnum of the key required
name door name   - makes the door's name/keywords = to the given name
remove arg       - used to remove keys, names, and descriptions
delete             - delete this exit
 
&WYou will start by creating the first room.
&Credit create 2000
&WThat will create the room and put you into the editor.
The, add flags, change sector by typing the flag name or
the sector name with nothing else.
&Cdark
forest
&WAnd so forth.  To enter the description of the room,
you need only type desc and that will put you into an editor
that you can write the description in.
Now, let's say you want to build a room north of this room.
The command you want can be one of several, depending on
what you want.
&Cnorth dig 1877
&WThis will create the room, assuming it doesn't exist, and
will also move you there.
&Cnorth link 1877
&WThis command requires that room 1877 already exist.  It
will then create a two way link to it from the room you're
in at the time.
&Cnorth room 1877
&WThis also requires that room 1877 already exist.  It
will create a one way link to the room.  You can go
there from where you are, but you can't come back south.
&Cnorth door closed locked
&WThis will create a door that closes and locks.  It
will reclose and relock at each area reset.
&Cnorth door CLOSED LOCKED
&WThis does the same thing, but the door will not reset to
closed and locked during area resets.
Also to note perhaps is that while in a room editor, you can't
just enter the commands north, east etc, and expect to move that
way.  The commands to do so while in an editor are &Cwalk direction

&CReseting Items to Rooms and Mobs
 
&WOkay, this is something I'm sure you will be interested
in doing at some point or another.  If you want to reset
an object somewhere, so that it loads on reboots and area
resets, you have to reset it to that room or mob.  To do
this.  You must be in redit for the room that the mob is
reset to, and that mob has to be present.  To reset an
object to a room, it is simply a matter of typing:
&Y
oreset vnum
&W
vnum being of course, the vnum of the object you want reset
to this room.  If you want to reset something to a mob,
you also use the oreset command while in redit, but you must
also note the mob you want, and the location to reset to.
To get a list of the locations, ? wear-loc in an editor. If
you want the item to goto the mobs inventory, use none.
Here are some examples:
&Y
oreset 5111 dragon dual      &WWill reset to mobs dual position
&Yoreset 7888 man none        &WWill reset to mobs inventory
~
E

&CObject Statistics
 
&WThese are the regulations for the addaffects and whatnot of
items.  If you desire to go beyond those bounds, talk to Tyrion.
 
&YAddaffect                 :Lv100:Lv101:Lv102:Lv103:Lv104:Lv105
hitroll/damroll weap/body : 60  : 66  : 72  : 78  : 84  : 90
hitroll/damroll for other : 20  : 22  : 24  : 26  : 28  : 30
hitpoints                 : 100 : 120 : 140 : 160 : 180 : 200
mana                      : 100 : 120 : 140 : 160 : 180 : 200
blood                     : 33  : 40  : 60  : 70  : 80  : 90
anti-disarm               : 100 : 100 : 100 : 100 : 100 : 100
 
&W2 stat raises, 2 points each.  Spell invokes to be used with caution.
For equipment lower than level 100, use appropriate ratios.  Example:
a level 80 object has 8/10's of the stats on level 100.  A level 45 would
have 4.5/10th the stats of a level 100.  Etc.
The syntax to add an affect is as follows:
&Y
addaff affecttype value
 
&WExample
 
&Yaddaff damroll 30
addaff ac -100
&W
For a complete list of where all you may apply add
affects to, use ? applies in the editor.

intro~
&CThe Basics
 
&WAll work done in an object editor is initiated by using the oedit command.
Typing oedit vnum will put you in an editor for that particular object.
Typing oedit create vnum will create a new object with the vnum you have
entered, and put you in an editor for that object vnum.
~
E

&CObject Types
 
&WThere are many different object types, I will attempt to explain them to
some degree, but many are simple in use and explanation, so I may not bother
too much.  While in an editor, you may type ? type to get a list of all the
possible object types.
 
light:  Rather simple, it let's you see in the dark.
scroll:  You can recite it, have to set level of spells and the spells themselves.
wand:  Zap for spells, see the chapter on invokes for more.
staff:  Brandish for spells, see the chapter on invokes for more.
weapon:  It's a weapon. Specify weapon type.  ? weapon in editor for list.
treasure:  Treasure is basically meant to be sold.
potion:  You quaff em, must specify spell level and spells on the potion.
noteboard:  Note commands used in room with this item goto this noteboard.
furniture:  Um...not sure that furniture has any special abilities.
trash:  It's trash....no real purpose.
container:  Holds stuff.  Can be made to open, close, and be locked.
drink-container:  Drink stuff.  ? liquid to get a list of liquids.
blood:  Makes it a blood type object.  I think for drinking...
key:  Type key opens locks.  Will dissappear if char leaves game.
food:  You eat it, has food hours to determine how long it lasts.
money:  You can make a pile of coins of a set value.
boat:  Can be used to traverse water.
npc corpse:  It's a corpse.
fountain:  A fountain.
pill:  You can eat it, similar to potions.
contact:  You can stare with it.
portal:  You enter it to a prescribed destination.
doll:  Smash to stun.
berry:  I "think" it's like a pill.
firearm:  Fire it.  Takes bullets.
implant:  Does not do anything yet that I know of.
rune:  For rune recall.

&CObject Flags
 
&WDue to the shear number of object flags, I refuse to go through each
one. Hence, I will go through the ones whose names are perhaps a tad
ambiguous.  The rest, ask someone if you have trouble.
 
&Ynolocate:  The spell locate object will not find this item.
magic:  Enchantments will cannot be cast on this item.
nodamage:  Makes the item indestructable.
inventory:  When the mobs who has it dies, it dissappears.
~

&CObject Progs
 
&WObject progs are rather unstable, there use is to be limited and
be sure to talk with Nexus or Tyrion about them if you feel the ardent
desire to play with fire.
Commands for oprogs are as follows:
&Yoplist: Lists current progs on the object you're editing.
opedit create: creates new prog.
opedit #: edits the appropriately numbered prog in oplist.
opremove #: deletes the numbered prog in oplist.
 
&WSee chapter five for a list of oprogs.

&CSpell Invokes
 
&WOkay, spell invokes are great.  But it must be kept in mind that
many spells are not meant to be put in the form of an invoke so that
just anyone can get their hands on them.  That takes away from the
uniqueness of the classes.  If you can get dark blessing invokes,
what then, is the point of ever making a vampire?  Now, how do you
set spell invokes.  Easy enough, if you read this.  I hope anyhow.
The commands are as follows.
 
&Yac_type:  type this with no arg to get a list. Pick the type of invoke you want.
ac_vnum:  Will declare the vnum of object/mob if it is of type morph/mload/oload.
ac_v1:  Number of charges it starts with.
ac_v2:  Max number of charges.
ac_setspell:  This is where you pick the spell.  Enclose it in 'these'
~
E
seven~
&CObject Joining and Separation
 
&WOkay, here's how you can make it so that two objects can
be joined together to make another item.  You have object A, B, and C.
Let's assume you want to have object A and B join to make C.
When editing objects A and B, you will type the command:
&Yojoin vnum
&WWhere vnum is the vnum of object C.  Now, so long as they both have
that, you can join those two items to create C.  Now, what
if you wanted to be able to separate object C into parts A and B?
Easy enough.  You edit C, and type these two lines:
&Yosepone vnum
oseptwo vnum2
&WWhere vnum is the vnum of A, and vnum2 is the vnum of B.  Then, when
a player types separate C, it will break into it's distinct pieces
A and B.

&CObject Wear Locations
 
&WTo get a list of all the possible wear location an object can have,
while in an editor, type ? wear-loc.
~
E
ten~
&CExtra Descriptions
 
&WThere are four different commands pertaining to extra descriptions.
They are very straightforward to use.
 
&Yed add keyword
 
&WThis will add the keyword to the list of keywords, and put you
into the editor where you can edit enter the description that is
to be associated with this object.
 
&Yed delete keyword
 
&WThis command will of course, simply remove this keyword from the list.
 
&Yed edit keyword
 
&WThis allows you to reenter the editor for that keyword, to make
changes and such.
 
&Yed format keyword
 
&WThis will remove extraneous space from the description.  i.e. if you
have a list of words going up and down, this will make it so each word
is beside the other, with a single space, on the same line, wrapping
where appropriate.

&CAdding Mobs to Rooms
&W
Adding a mob to a room is fairly straightforward.  You
first off, have to be in redit for the room to which you
wish to put the mob.  Then, it is simply a matter of using
the mreset command.  Example:
&Y
mreset 3254
&W
This will reset mob 3254 to the room.  Now, you might also
be curious about reseting more than one of the same mob to
a room.  This is done in a similar fashion.
 
&Ymreset 4552 3
&W
This will reset three of the same mobs to the room.  You
need only set the equip on the mob once though.  The way it
works however is as follows.  Every area reset, it will load
another of mob 4552, up to the point where there is 3 of them.
When there are 3, it will not load another, until one is killed.
Once one is dead, at next area reset, another will be
loaded.
~
E
eight~
&CItem Shops
&W
Item shops are not a function of rooms, but a function of the mobs
themselves.  You declare a mob as a shopkeeper by using aspects of
the shop command.  To get a list of these, type shop while in the
editor, nothing else.  You'll get the following:
&Y
Syntax:  shop hours [#opening] [#closing]
         shop profit [#buying%] [#selling%]
         shop type [#0-4] [item type]
         shop delete [#0-4]
         shop remove
&W
First, we'll look at shop hours.  You have the opening and closing.
It's fairly straightforward, to set the times that you can actually
buy stuff from the mob, you type: &Yshop hours 0 24&W, for instance.
That would make the shop open all day long.  By the way, these times
are mud times of course.
 
Now we'll look at shop profit.  This sets the selling and buying
value of objects, based on their natural value.  For example, if
you have an object worth 1000 coins.  And the buying value is 100,
you buy it at normal cost.  If you were to set the buying value
at 150, a pc would have to pay 1500 for the object.  The ratio
likewise affects selling price for the selling part.  So, to
set this, type: &Yshop profit 150 50&W for example.
 
Shop type decides what types of items the shop keeper deals in,
i.e. weapons, scrolls, potions, whatever.  You have to declare
what the mob will deal in.  You can have a max of five different
item types.  You declare them by using the shop type command. For
example, &Yshop type 0 scrolls &Wand&Y shop type 1 potions&W.
To remove a shop type, use the shop delete command and the
associated number. &Yshop delete 0&W.
 
To remove all aspects of shopkeeping from a mob, use the shop
remove command.  Will clear everything, leaving mob as per normal.

[Description]:                     Desc you get when looking at mob.
 
&Y* Okay, explanation on the items with * beside the desc.
Name is the keywords, meaning that when you want to select
this mob in a command, these are the words that will work.
Example:  If the mob's name is bob guard man, you can type
kill man, or kill bob, or kill guard.  If the short is only A
Guard of Aurum, you can still use man and bob as keywords.
Short desc is bascially when the mob does something.  If
the mob says hi, it writes, mobshortdesc says 'hi'.  This
is also the name used during combat, Whoever's poison pierce
annihalates you etc.  So shorts, should, as per the name, be
fairly short.
Longs are the line you see when you first walk into a room
and a mob occupies it.  A guard named bob stands here.
Something along that line.  It's used to say, Hey, here's
my mob, look at him/her/it.

A Stone Path~
~
~
You walk along a path of carefully laid flat stones that goes to the
east.  On either side of you are towering oaks that reach far up into
this underground cavern.  The path continues to the east, where you
can see that an eerie light grows from an unknown source, and also,
you hear something humming.  You feel something just isn't right, but you
know not what.

A Stone Path~
~
~
The path of flat stones continues through the forest.  Ahead of you, the
strange light grows stronger as you get closer and the humming sound
intensifies, disturbing your thinking.  The feeling of something wrong
persists, and suddenly it hits you, this forest path is totally devoid
of life besides the towering oaks that stand in the silence around
you.  The source of the odd light and the weird humming continues to
beckon you from the east.

Portal to Aurum~
~
~
You enter a spacious clearing, at it's center stands an 8 foot tall
portal, surrounded by a glowing nimbus of white light, it seems to be
the source of the humming.  The surface of the portal is nothing but
a black haze, revealing nothing of the other side.  The path of flat
stones leads straight to the portal.  You notice that on the last stone
before the portal, an inscription covered in dirt and moss.  Scraping
it away with a stick, you read the word Aurum.

A Small Island~
~
~
You're on a small island, perhaps fifty yards across.  Surrounding you
is nothing buy water.  Only two other objects share this desolate space
with you, a lonely wooden hut to the east, and the glowing portal that
brought you here, which emits only a faint humming now, but still glows
just as brightly as before.  From the hut to the east, you can hear the
sound of someone, talking to themself.
From the corner of your eye, you also glimpse something enormous high
in the sky above you.  Looking up, you see a huge island floating in the
air above this island.  From down here, you can discern no more details
about it.

~

A human man greets you as you enter his home.  The inside of the hut is
quite clean, well swept, and neatly arranged.  You see a shelf lined with
books, a small cot, a wardrobe, and a small area for cooking and eating.
A single window looks out on the island, resting on the window sill are
various potted flowers, which it seems this man keeps good care of.
Currently, the man seems to be drinking a cup of tea, while reading a
book entitled "Riddles".

by the calm sea.

The Final Approah to Aurum~
~
~
You are now level with the Floating Island of Aurum.  Set in the center
of the Island is an immense castle with walls that are a brilliant
white.  Graceful towers occupy the four corners of the wall.  And another
tower, far more graceful, and standing far higher than the other four
towers rises from the center.  The only entrace seems to be a golden
gate on the southern wall.  You see birds and small objects carried by
the wind repulsed by an invisible field of magicel energy.  That gate
is the only way in.

The Golden Gates of Aurum~
~
~
The Golden Gates of Aurum loom before you, absolute in their power to
stop tresspassers from entering.  They seem to be made of solid gold,
but are most likely only covered in the precious metal.  Various images
of creatures of magic adorn the surface of the gate and wall, dragons,
manticores, unicorns, and hundreds more, many that you are unfamiliar
with.  Before the Gates, a single guard stands her vigil in silence.

You have been flying for quite some time now.  You wonder when you will
reach your destination.  Pyran's Island is but a spec of brown sand in
the deep blue sea far below you.  The huge mass of rock that is Aurum
looms above you.

Within Aurum~
~
~
You are surrounded by the beauty of Aurum.  The main wall is to the
south.  To the north is an impressive building that is as white as the
wall that protects it.  In the space between the wall and the building
grows a garden of many beautiful flowers and trees.  Within it, you can
catch glimpses of flowers the likes of which you have never seen before.
To the north is the entrance into the castle itself.  Standing beside
the gate you just came in through, you notice a man who operates the
gate on this side of the wall.

The Castle Doors~
~

You stand before two doors made of a wood that you are not entirely
familiar with.  A guard in flowing red robes stands to either side of
the door, watching those who seek entrance to the castle proper.  Looking
a ways to the east and west, you can see two of the four towers that
are built into the corners of the outer wall rising high above the rest
of the castle.  To your immediate east and west is the Garden.

Leaving behind the castle and its people, you enter the garden that
surrounds Aurum.  You can hear the sounds of various animals within
the vegetation.  Some of these sounds are deep and loud enough that
they must come from animals that are indeed very large.  You stop to
wonder if this is a garden that is meant to be walked through, or to
be eaten in.

and wonder if he/she is alone in that task.

oaks, lindens, birches, some that you are not familiar with. All of which

A tower, rising high up into the air, stretches from this section of the

find no entrance to the tower here, you can only guess that it is hidden
elsewhere.

some have broadswords sheathed at their waists, and seem to you perhaps
to be knights of some holy order.  Couples can be seen sitting beneath
the shade of a tree, talking quietly with each other, as animals that
dwell in the Garden go about their own business.

Exploring the Garden~
~
~
Walking through the Garden, following simple trails of down trodden
grass, you feel nearly overwhelmed by all the pollen that's in the air.
The various smells are almost too much for your nose to handle, as they
assault you from all directions, coming from hundreds upon hundreds of
different flowers. You notice to your west, a door, hidden among vines
and other vegetation, a solid door of oak.  Inscribed on the door is
a crown of leaves.

Trees rise high above you, many stretch higher than the walls themselves.
Birds chirp as they fly from tree to tree, then stopping to rest for
a moment before flying off again. You have yet to find any sign of the
caretaker of this wonderful place, and no one can offer much help on
his location.

Passage to the Tower of Life~
~
~
Your feet fall quietly on the soft grass that grows beneath your feet.
The hall is dark, betraying no hint of life besides yourself.  As your
eyes adjust to the light, you can see that the walls and floors are
moving.  Turning to look at the wall more closely, you see that the
walls are covered in vines.  These vines seem to be in constant motion.
Undulating where they rest on the walls, almost as if they are waiting
for you to step into them, so that they may embrace you.

remain motionless.

The Tower of Life~
~
~
You're in a large circular room with glowing balls of light floating
at intervals along the wall around you. The walls are a pristine white,
at least, that is what you think you can see through all the vines and
other plant life that covers the ceiling, floor, and walls of this room
as it did in the hallway. Here however, the strange movement of the vines
and such is erratic and follows no established pattern. The mumbling
seems to be a man's voice coming from above, but still, you can decipher
none of what's being said. A stairway at the northern side of the room
goes up.

Room of the Guardian of Life~
~
~
The room is similar to the previous rooms.  Plant life grows all around
you.  But you notice something wrong with it. The plants near to the
ceiling and on the ceiling itself seem to be in a state of decay.  The
sound of the mumbling is somewhat coherent now, you can hear bits and
pieces of what is being said.  The speaker seems to be talking about
demons, evil sorcerors, and a place of darkness called Merentha.

Chamber of Life~
~
~
Walking into this room, you might feel just a little confused as to
what has befallen it. Looking around, you watch as the plant life in
the room decays before your eyes, and then grows back, full of life.
Taking your eyes from that, you look at the rest of the room. A desk
sits in the middle of the room, chairs are scattered about, and a small
bed lies overturned against the east wall.

Among the Flowers~
~
~
Flowers are arranged quite neatly here, in nice little rows and patterns.
Some form shapes that draw your attention, a heart, a sword, the sun,
and various other things. You wonder that this place isn't infested with
any of those animals notorious for digging around in such rich soil as
this surely is.

Walking Along the Garden Paths~
~

Flowers on long stems sway gently in the light breeze and it sweeps
through the Garden, ruffling your hair and clothes. Flowers of every
colour adorn the stems, emitting a variety of different scents, most
of which are quite pleasant to the senses. Bees fly from flower to flower
in the effort to gather all the pollen.

A colourful butterfly rises into the air as you approach it, timid little
creatures, they seldom let people come near them, for fear of us much
larger beings crushing them by accident. None the less, it is a very
beautiful creature with all the lovely colours all over its wings, the
two being in perfect symetry.

The Garden stretches to the south and the north of you, and continues
a few feet to the west. Life is abundant all about you, though little
of it is fauna in proportion to the amount of flora. Though, you do see
the occaisional critter moving about, birds, bees, cats, etc.

A fountain of cool white marble lies in the center of a small pool of
water.  The dragon rests on it's hind legs, sitting up with it's two
forelegs resting in front, it's mouth gaping a bit, allowing water to
trickle through, into the pond. Several fish swim in the pond, brightly
coloured and quite quick, they zoom around from place to place with
total abandon, never resting in the same spot for very long.

The ground rises slightly here, most likely from the efforts of an giant
oak that grows here. The tree stretches high into the air, high enough
that the foliage prevents you from seeing its crest from your position.
Small symbols are scrawled into the bark of the tree. Small tokens of
love from young couples, something that may have lasted longer than they.

You watch silently as a small tabby chases a butterfly that it hasn't
a chance of catching, but none the less continues to try and catch the
fluttering target. The cat pounces here and there, desparately trying
to get a claw hold on the poor fly, but is not successful. The cat gives
up after a few seconds, and goes to rest in some shade after its small
exertion.

name is scrawled onto the door, it reads, "&CJoram, the Gardener&Y".

Tall, ageless trees grow up out of the ground before you.  They stretch
far to the east, growing close, but not too close to the north wall.
The wall preventing the roots from spreading very far.  The tower high
above you, blocking out the suns light, and providing more than a little
shade to allow you to rest in if you so chose to do so.
You stand in the shadows of a tall slender tower that rises up to the
north of you.  This slender spire is the home of someone, do you dare
intrude on them or not though, that is up to you.

The walls are splotched gray and white, black flecks here and there. A
window is placed at each point of the compass, allowing light into the
room.  There are, spaced about the room, old suits of polished steel
plate mail, chain mail, and full plate.  The floor is awfully soft, and
it seems to be well worn.  Perhaps this is a room that is often used for
training, the floor soft to lessen the blow of falling.  If so, it would
seem that those who use it are perhaps a bit soft themselves.

The gray and white splotched walls are all around you, the black flecks
still apparent also.  Besides this, you notice something else wrong with
the wall.  Getting closer look, you realize that all over the walls, there
all long slashes, starting shallow, going deep, then finishing shallow
again.  If it didn't seem foolish, you would almost think that these
were marks of a sword.  Opposite the stairway you used to get to this
floor, there is another stairway going  .  At the foot of these stairs
is a tall figure resplendant in spotless white armour, an enormous two
handed sword is before him, tip in the ground, and his hands rest on
the hilt, the glowing blue eyes in the helm rest on you.
Do you wish to test the might of this inanimate warrior?

Old suits of armor, polished swords, maces, hammers, knives, daggers
and numerous others weapons and armour are place about the room.  Some
are obviously on display, to be seen only, but some do seem to have seen
a certain amount of use.  The walls here are a pristine white, without
a single blemish on their surface.  Light seeps in through five windows.
The light comes in strongest through two of the five, and is focused on the
center of the room, where a man in white armour, the edges softened with
gold, stands.  He moved in motions that seem fluid and perfect, flawless.
His sword reflects the light that touches it, sometimes reflecting back
to your eyes as you stand there.  He seems totally unaware that you have
entered the room, and he continues working with his blade.

now.  Also, to the north, you can see a tall slender white tower that

You are in a corridor of white walls that continues to the north.  The
walls are wide enought to admit three people standing abreast of each
other, and high enough to allow four standing on top of each other to fit
comfortably, (That is as comfortable as standing on someone's head can
be.)  Above you, light filters down through simple panes of coloured
glass that have been placed in the ceiling.  Decorating the walls are
numerous tapestries that show various images that could best be described
using the adjective "Religious".  The floor beneath you is polished white
marble, intact, shining, and without a noticable scratch.

else that can draw your eyes but the mass of people in the adjoining
room who chant out to their god, trying to find for themself eternal
peace in the life that comes after.

They are wearing long, pristine white robes, absent of any dust, dirt
or stains of any kind, they sit with heads bowed, hands clapsed before
them, softly repeating the chant of the priest before them.  There are
large coloured glass windows around the room, showing important events
in this cities religion, and overall allowing light to enter the large,
cavernous room.

in it when you walk across it.  All around you in this circular room, there

from the previous images you saw.  These must show the more important
events that took place in this cities religion.  On the opposite side of
the room, you see a stairway going up, and you also see a humonoid shaped
being made of silver, or what you see of it is silver.  It wears a white
robe that covers most of it's form, leaving only silver feet, hands, and
a face and head of silver visible.

This room could best be described as opulent and lavishly decorated. The
smell of inscense is thick in the air, a light smoke hangs in about the
room, being slowly cleared by the 5 windows spaced around the circular
wall. But there is always more inscense being burnt around the room. The
furniture is all gilded with gold and silver, trinket adorn the surfaces
of these things, also of gold, silver, and precious stones too. There is
but one person in the room.  A woman wearing a very ornate, decorative
white robe, gold, red, and blue thread creating a intricate and colourful
sunburst on her breast.  She watches you silently as you enter the room.

Tulips all about~

Tulips are the primary flower about you, growing in small beds, or here
and there in the grass.  They range wildly in colour, anything from black
to red, to yellow, to green.  There are numerous bumblebees flying all
around you, collecting pollen from the flowers, I would try not to anger
them, they are slightly more vicious than your common variety bee.

The Garden~
~
~
You're in the Garden.  You are surrounded by flowers, trees, vines etc.
However, you see hanging in the air a painting... Nothing seems to be
holding it up in the air, you can walk around it, look above and below,
but there doesn't seem to be any explanation for why it's in the air
the way it is.  The painting itself shows a woman, dressed in long,
white robes, standing in a room of white marble, hands poised above
the head of someone who seems to have been pierced through the heart.

The Towering Redwood~
~
~
You stand at the base of a redwood so high, you can't see even close to
the top.  Leaves rustle softly in the wind, the only sound that you can
hear.  There is a small hole in the tree, about 4 feet up the tree.  From
where you stand, you do not know what is in the hole, perhaps you should
look.

The Florist~
~
~
A woman sits on a wooden stool behind a simple stand adorned with many
bouquets of flowers, reading a book.  She nods at you as you approach,
glancing briefly at you, then returning to her reading.  You see small
pieces of paper affixed to the bouquets, and realize that she must be
selling them.  Some of the prices seem mighty high, but then, what better
way to show your love to your beloved.

A Hedge Statue~
~
~
Numerous hedges grow around you, some have even been shaped into animals
and other such things.  You're not sure, but you think that some of
the statues seem to be eyeing you up...watching you as if you were some
piece of meat to be eaten.

Walking with the Flowers~
~
~
Flowers surround you, you find it hard to avoid crushing them with each
step that you take, but you manage to some degree, crushing only a few.
Birds trill sharp notes high above you in the branches of tall trees,
flying about in the warm air, doing as they wish.

of various colours all about you, the variety in the colours dazzling
your eyes.

Grove of the Dragonfly~
~
~
You enter a grove of high standing dense hedges.  Within, you come face
to face with a somewhat curious creature.  The size of a small dragon,
it looks very much like one, except that instead of huge leathery wings,
it has four slim and fairly small gossamer wings, which, even while it
sits here resting, hum slightly, fluttering rapidly.  In addition, it
has multifaceted eyes, similar to the kind of eyes you would expect to
see on a fly.  Its lips curse into what may or may not be a smile as
you enter the grove, of course, it could very well be a snarl.

Fountain of Ice~
~
~
Surrounded by a ring of red tulips, a fountain that seems to be made
entirely of ice spouts water from many different ice carvings.  Attached
to a spire of ice that is perhaps twelve feet high, there are small
figures of pixies, fish, seahorses, all with mouths open, spouting clear
clean water into a pool below.

up and down trees, and people are lazing about in the sun.  Flora
of all kinds and colours are around you.

Growing Vegetation~
~
~
Vines cover the east section of wall, creating a huge network of vines
intertwining with each other.  A couple of children in plain white robes
scamper up the wall, using the vines as handholds.  Flowers can be seen
growing within the vines, the children picking some of them, to take
cast word to their mother most likely.

Flora of various shape, texture and colour is all about you, mixed in
with it is various fauna also.  Pools of water are here and about also,
perhaps used by the flowers, a source of water to quench the thirst of
their roots.  People in simple robes and fancy robes laze about in the
warm sun, lounging on against the trunks of trees reading a book, or
talking quietly to someone.

In the Shadows of the Tower of Harmony~
~
~
A tall, slender spire of pristine white marble rises to your south.
Even from without, you can hear music from within, a sound that is both
in harmony with all around it, and beautiful sounding, in no way able
to cause your ears harm.  But you know that he who creates this mucis
is more than capable of turning it to a more harmful purpose.  You hope
that you are never required to fight such an odd weapon.

Beneath the Tower of Harmony~
~
~
You are on the bottom floor of what is known as the Tower of Harmony.
Here lives Lynar, Keeper of the Ancient Histories, and a fine singer
and teller of tales.  Around you, the walls reverberate with the sound
of music.  The sweet sound flows down from above you, caressing your
eyes, seeking only to please you.  You wonder if there is some sort of
enchantment hidden in the music, to beguile and charm the listener.
But you can only guess.  Staring around at the simple room, white walls
glistening, a stairway to the north winding up higher into the tower,
you don't think much harm can come to you here.

Room of the Guardian of Harmony~
~
~
The room is quite simple, white wall that are unembelished, bearing no
marks and no oranation of any kind.  The floor is a polished wood, that
reflects the light coming in through a single one of four windows, each
placed at one of the points of the compass.  Stairs to the south spiral
up, going higher into the tower.  But, at the foot of those stairs is
a creature quite unlike any you have ever seen before.  You watch it with
a certain amount of apprehension as it approaches you, wind coming in
through a window blowing through this creature of brass and wood.

The Tower of Harmony~
~

Looking out the window to your immediate right as you climb the final
stair, you note that you are a fair distance up in the air, a fall to
the ground below would be somewhat painfull.  The rest of the room opens
up before you.  You see a man dressed in a red ensemble sitting before
a harp, softly strumming it, and singing a few words, then reaching over
to write something on a piece of paper which rests on the simple oak
desk beside him.  Resting about the room are quite a few other musical
intruments, various lutes, flutes, drums, whistles, just about anything
you could imagine, you could find here in this room.  You take another
step into the room, and the man who you assume is Lynar looks up at you.

Path in the Garden~
~
~
You walk along a simple stone path that splits the garden down the
middle.  The surfuce of the stone is smooth in texture, and black in
colour.  The walls loom up on either side of you, one barring entrance
to the keep, the other barring away the outside world.

Path in the Garden~
~

You walk on a stone path, leading the the west, parellel to the walls
that rise to the north and the south.  Flowers grow about you, lending
their many distinct aromas to the air.  Animals, most of them of the
small sort: rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, scamper about beneath your
feet.  The magical shield above you shimmers as a bird attempts to fly
in.

Stone blocks make up a path beneath your feet.  A ways to the west, you
can see guards standing before a large door, made of a metal that seems
to be a pale blue in colour, it's texture smooth.  About you the Garden
thrives, the flora growing in an unabated abundance.

woven red carpet, images however are woven within the carpet the creator
using any colour he or she deemed appropriate.  Blues, yellows, greens,
anything.  The images depict dragons in battle, mages working at some
great and powerful spell, scenes from religon, renditions of important
people in the history of Aurum.  The vaulted ceiling is high above, glass
windows allowing in the only light, at this time of day, there is no magic
in use for that purpose.  People stand in and among the columns, some
talking to each other, others just content to wait for their turn to talk
to Tiana.

Door to the Tower of Order~
~
~
You stand before a door of silver metal, it seems to glow softly, but in
the bright light, you find it hard to discern if it does indeed glow. Its
surface is heavily carved with intricate patterns.  A silver rose rests
in each of the four corners, a perfect image of that real flower.  In
the very center of the door, there is a circle of some redish metal, one
you can't recall ever having seen before.  The silver inside this circle
is without any markings, it's surface is smooth, with the exception of a
simple indentation, that of a four leaved flower.

The Tower of Order~
~

You are in a fairly narrow, unadorned hall, it is naught but a perfect
square in proportions.  There are no marks, no objects of value, nothing.
Also, there is complete silence, playing with the door to the south does
nothing to make the noise from the south grow louder....it's just non-
existing.  Somehow, the sound is blocked off from this section of the
castle.  It would seem that Tiana does not like to be disturbed.

Beneath the Tower of Order~

This room is a similar cube to the one to the west, unadorned, plain, and
very, very quiet.  You wonder if anyone actually is in the tower.  There
are no windows that let in light, no secret or hidden doors.  You can
see only a stairwell going up on the north wall.  If it follows the way
all the other towers are built, you think it's safe to assume there is a
golem waiting for you on the other end of those stairs.  How it reacts
depends entirely on you.

This room is huge, you don't think, considering the room below, that this
room could be this size, for it is much bigger than the previous, yet
the tower has a slender appearance if percieved from outside.  There is
another being in the room beside you.  It seems to be a plain white statue
of marble.  It has nothing but the most basic of features. Nose, arms,
fingers etc.  It watches you with its plain white eyes as you move about
the room, waiting for you to do or say something.

This is Tiana's office, where she does all the work that keeps Aurum
running efficently and smooth.  A plain wooden desk seams to dominate
the room, littered with papers.  There is also a low table, on which
sits a pot of what smells like tea and several cups.  There are many
windows through which the warm light of the sun flows, where it
is caught on little figurines made of crystal, refracting the light
through the room.

also in perfect order on the desk.  The woman behind the desk is looking
at you, her eyes closing to slits, wondering what you're up to, and ready
to "Shhhh" you should you attempt to talk too loud.  Her red robes are
clean, with a small sunburst pattern in gold thread on the left shoulder.
You notice that her desk is a veritable safe, many locked drawers, the
keys nowhere to be seen.

Ah, the sweet smell of good cooking comes at you from the east.  Daring
you to goto it and seek its source.  Your stomach starts to rumble as
the smell grows stronger and stronger, tantalizing you, silently telling
you to eat, eat to your hearts content, and/or desire.  You find it hard
to resist.  Do you manage to maintain control, or will you goto Nadia
and ask of her some sweets or some other delicious morcel?

The smell of various foods is strong about you. The smell of sizzling
meats, boiling vegetables, and simmering sauces floats to you on gentle
currents of air, tantalizing your palate. Cooks run about in quite the
rush, barely paying you any heed.  Just going around you when you get
in their way.  Ah, the meal must get done.

This corner of the room seems to be reserved for stock.  You see many
bags of flour, jars of vegetables stacked on shelves in great number.
Does it not make you curious as to just how much on those shelves is
used each day?  This place must use up quite the fair bit of food, but
where does it all come from?  Perhaps they have farm lands outside of
the castle where they harvest all their food.

Cooks run about, spilling flour all over the place. Time and again eggs
are dropped to the floor, where they crack and are ruined.  There is
quite the number off broken eggs on the floor you notice, and you're
not sure who is responsible for cleaning up the mess, but you do know
that they are not doing a very good job at it.

A pot of some sort of stew boils to your right, a slab of meat sizzles
over a fire to your left, straight ahead, you can see a shelf of breads,
all fresh, straight out of the oven, only the freshest for the leaders
of Aurum.  There are all sorts of cheeses to be seen on another shelf
beside the former one.  Most of them ranging in colours of orange and
whites, but there are more exotic colours seen too.

Pastries are all about, some out to cool, others collected in baskets,
ready to be brought out to eat.  There are so many different ones, you
don't think it's really worth your while to count the number of kinds.
You just know that each and every kind looks absolutely delicious. A
great deal of effort is given to make sure that these are the best of
the best, the worlds finest.  Course, as little of the population of
Aurum has seen much besides Aurum, it's easy for the cooks to give their
foods such titles.

The room is fairly clean, despite the small clods of rich soil lying
here and there on the ground. The room has a nice earthly smell to it,
almost as if you were still outside on a nice spring day after a short
rainfall. Tools of all sorts hang from the walls, used to maintain the
Garden in its meticulous shape. A chest of decent size rests against
the wall, closed and locked. A small man, sitting on that very chest,
watches you as you enter the room, his eyes wary.

This section of the kitchen is a mess, batter all over the place, eggs
lying here and there in bowls, waiting to be cracked, slabs of meat
soaking in Nadia's special sauces, so that the flavour is nothing but
the best when they are cooked.  Now, I'd be careful about what you try
to eat in her presence, she just might get mad and throw you on the
cutting board.

A door to the east leads into another room.  Most likely the dining
room.  Servants run back and forth through it carrying trays that Nadia
and the assistant cooks prepare with haste, yet with also a careful
precision.  Making sure that nothing is forgotten.  It would seem that
the people who eat in the other room experience quite a variety of foods
judging by the trays that are being brought to them.

A huge room with a high vaulted ceiling from which dangles many the

seen tapestries, most of which are landscapes, depicting soaring birds
high on mountain tops, fish in the ocean, and deer grazing on a meadow.
All seem to be of very fine quality and stunning perfection.

waiting until just before the meal is to be served before putting it

magic is thick around you.  That it's very essence permeates the air.

nothing seems to really show up in it the way it would normally work..
It's like...as long as you have the light, you see things as if it's the

so black...it makes the night sky look bright in comparison..This is

&RPassage to the East~
~
~
&zThe sound of chanting can be heard through the door to the north.  A
most unholy litany of words and music.  The words used are rough edged
and harsh.  A symbol is burned into the wood of the door, it depicts
a knife piercing a heart.  From the sound you can hear nothing, it is
enshrouded in blissful silence.  Opening the door and walking in is
the only way to give answers as to what it beyond.

&RPassage to the East~
~
~
&zThe hallway goes to the east and west, the portal that will take you
back to Aurum is to the west.  The east brings you deeper into Merentha.
To where one of the Nightlords of Merentha makes their home.  The walls
of black obsidian close in around you, narrowing, you must now walk in
single file.

&zThe walls flare out again, giving you room to walk again.  Light can
be seen to the east.  You can see that the passage branches to the north
and south where the light is, and that it also continues to the east.
Shadows move on the floor to the west of the light... But you see nothing
casting the shadows...

~

&zRed light falls from above, produced by floating red balls of magic.
Shadows are all about you, moving along the walls and watching you...
The passage goes to the east, where you see a stairwell going down into
the earth.  It also goes back to the west, where the portal to Aurum is.
You can also go to the north, which you can see later turns off to the
west.  And there is a similar hallway going to the south and then west.

&RAbove the Pit of Sin~
~

&zYou're at the top of a large staircase going deep into the earth...
Blood trickles down in little rivulets along the wall, gathering in a
pool that you can see far below you.  Bats line the ceiling occaisionly
swoop down at you, doing little more than annoy you.  The walls here
aren't the normal obsidian that you've been seeing in the rest of this
place.  These walls are made of numerous stones that are about the size
of fairly big chests.  They make it seem that perhaps this was at one
time a part of some castle, which is now buried in this earth.

&RThe Pit of Blood~
~

&zWalking along the stairs, you come to notice that this is not the same
black obisidian that makes up the rest of Merentha, these walls are made
up of blocks of stone, more what you would expect from some castle that
has to withstand the bitter elements.  Perhaps this once was above the
ground and the sun did once shine upon it's walls.  Looking out a window
now filled with stone, you wonder what you might once have looked out on
in the past.

obsidian reflecting light.  The ground beneath your feet is naught but
hard granite, making for a walk that is not among the most comfortable
you can remember.  The sound of laughter and screaming begins to die
away a bit as you walk further to the south, going away from that first
intersection.  Creatures hide in the shadows of the uneven ceiling,
from which hangs numerous stalactites.  Things like bats and stuff.

blood flows out of it into the ground.  A veritable fountain of the red

&ROuter Hall of Merentha~
~
~
&zEvil wanders thtis hall as surely as you do....Although in what form
it walks in is unknown, and is pretty much an unlimited number of things.
There is little you can do except be on your guard at all times and to
never let that very same guard down lest you risk your life and soul
to whatever evil it is that lurks in the darkness.

&RTraining Chamber~
~
~
&zYou are in a large room, racks of weapons and armor and other such equipment are lined all along the wall, whereas the rest of this rather
huge room is left vacant and empty space, save for the people who are on
it training.  Practicing their swordplay, magic uses etc.  The people
of Merentha would never let themselves fall into a state of laziness,
lest when the time came for them to rise against Aurum, the might not
be ready.

&RPassage to the South~
~
~
&zDarkness..there is little else to describe as you wander along...
The light to the south is growing stronger, you think you see shadows
in that area, but you're unsure as of yet.  The dark obsidian seems to
be glistening around you now.  Looking closer, you notice that the walls
are a little damp.

&RA Dank Dark Prison Cell~
~
~
&zA disgusting room of dirt and filth.  You can't imagine ever being
forced to live in such conditions yourself.  Do you think it right that
others should live in such conditions?  The room is so cold..dust is
thick in the air, causing you to choke a bit as you breath.

&zDarkness swirls around you, were it not a dead thing, you would think it
was trying to swallow the light around you.  It's almost animate in the
way the shadows are formed about you, made to seem to move and be alive,
then vanish into nothingness once more.  Never o bother you again. Life
is nonetheless abundant all around you.  Hiding in corners and shadows
waiting for you to turn your back...So that they might attack and kill.

&RThe Southern Intersection of Passages~
~
~
&zYou find yourself in a fairly well lit four way intersection.  The
light is provided by glowing red orbs high above you, which casts shadows
all about, even though there doesn't seem to be anything in between the
light and the shadows to create them...  The water running down the walls
looks alive in the odd red light, giving you the impression of being
within some huge living being that has swallowed you whole.  Of course..
how sure are you that such is not the case?...

&ROuter Hall of Merentha~
~
~
&zDark things move in the shadows around you, hissing and making sounds
gutteral and wispy.  They watch from afar, waiting for just the right
moment at which to pounce, to attack you while you are unawares and
unexpecting.  They seek to draw from you the sustenance they need to
survive.  And since you're unlikely to give that willingly, they must
take from you what they need.... Which is anything from your flesh to
your gold and valuables.

&RAbove the Pit of Death~
~
~
&zYou are at the very top of what is know as the pit of death.  So far,
from what you can see, it's not a very happy place.  Corpses seem to have
just been thrown wherever to rot and putrefy.  You can see that most
are in an advanced stage of decay, and there are maggots and other such
carrion eaters all over the place.  The smell is not something that most
would desire either.

&zThe number of corpses around you is astounding.... The number of dead
is amazing...you have to wonder where they get all these people from
without anyone raising up a cry about it.  You think that you can see,
past the occaisional corpse, part of a stone wall, not this wall of black
obsidian that doesn't seem to end.

&zThere is about you, a stench of decay...  The putrid smell of flesh
as it slowly decomposes.  It's enough to make you gag.  Of course, there
are some who can stand up to such noxious odours, though you wonder how
they do it.... Or why?  Anyhow, there are bodies all around you, most
seem to be in a fairly good state..none are readily decaying or rotting
before your eyes.  There are some that even seem to be alive, but not
alive enough for you to believe that the person they once were is back
again.

~

&zYou walk along a narrow stone staircase, smooth from years and years
of erosion.  There is little noise around you save sounds that you are
making yourself, there being nothing else around you.  Occaisionly..
you think you hear something from far below...a scream...or a deep and
low gutteral roar....  From what, you're not sure you want to find out.

&zLarge stones make up the walls of the tower like room you find yourself
in.  There are windows about the tower walls, but none of them look out
onto anything besides solid rock.  There is a door leading up back the
way that you came, and there is a door at the bottom of the staircase
that leads down deeper into the earth.  Something you didn't really notice
at first..but that dawns on you now, is that this room is unusually hot..

&zYou find yourself in a huge room, the walls of which are made of huge
stone blocks, cut from obsidian you think.  There is little in this room
that even suggests to you that whoever lives here is a happy soul.  There
is in the center of the room a pool of lava...from it radiates the intense
heat you felt earlier and now it is far more intense, nearly scalding your
skin even though you stand a decent distance away.  The lava seems to
move about you, but nothing surfaces, so you take it to only be bubbles
of heat.

A Forest Glade~
~
~
A simple forest glade, bereft of all life save one little sprite which
watches you very carefully, waiting for your slightest move.  It weaves
in and about the leaves of the branches above you with ease, not even
grazing a leaf, only the affect of it's passage in the air causing the
leaves to sway gently.

A Room with Blue Light~
~
~
You're in a large open room.  Lit with an odd blue light that seems to
crackle in the air, it has no visible source that you can see with your
own eyes however.  There is something to the north...  There is a glow in
that room that isn't quite the same as the blue glow around you.  There
it is far more intense, almost pulsing with energy.

A Pool of Magic~
~
~
You find yourself in a room that is basically a dome made of clean grey
granite.  The ceiling is perhaps 10 meters above you, and there is a pool
of some glowing blue liquid in the center of the room.  Looking at it,
you can feel waves of power emanating from it.  This is raw magic, that
has somehow been harnessed into a more physical form for who knows what
use.

~

You step onto a stone path to either side of which are towering oak
trees.  Considering how far beneath the earth you are, you have no
idea how such things can possibly grow here.  There is a huge black
wall to the north, and you can see that the stone path parallels it.
