Salin~
A man sneaks around here in an earthen coloured robe.
~
A man of middle age stands before you.  His long grey hair tumbles down
his back in large curls.  As you look to his face, there seems to be a pain
or some kind of anguish there.  His brown robes are stained with blood and
dirt, suggesting he lives out here in the wilderness.

His hair is brown, but when you look to his eyes you see that he is
timeless.  The fabled longevity of the druids, as you now know, is true.  He
strokes a large oaken staff in his one hand, and his other is never far away
from the longsword on his belt.

An aged druid sits at his desk studying a scroll.

Your eyes fall upon Dlraxor, leader of the druids.  He is known to them
only as 'The Guardian'.  When you look at his face, he seems troubled.  His
eyes tell a story that he would rarely speak to anyone.  He looks like a man
who has committed a grave sin, and would do anything to be able to repent
for it.  He hardly seems to take notice of you and continues to read over
his scroll.

stands in the corner of the training grounds, and watches her students. 
Berating those who are failing, and...  rewarding...  those who succeed.

An Ancient Black Wyrm~
A massive black dragon fills the cavern
~
A very large black dragon fills this cavern almost completely.  It is a
wonder how it even got in here considering its size.  One of its eyes is
discolored white, most likely blinded by some battle long ago.  Its other
good eye stays trained upon you as you come close.  The eye itself is almost
twice the size of an average Human!  The smell of evil and rotting flesh
permeates from its maw as it breathes, choking the most iron stomachs.

guarding it are powerful, and those who are weaker should not venture forth
past this sign.  If you do try to face the dangers here you have been
warned.  I have tried and failed to make it through here, and this sign is a
warning to all who may try after me.  
 
I am weak, but I am also flesh.
I can be stronger, and will return.
I have failed, but wilil return.

Deep in the Forest~
thunder6.wav~
~
As you enter this dreary forest a cold breath of wind buffets your face. 
The cold is almost unbearable, but the sun is shining and the rest of the
land seems warm.  To the north, high up on a mountain precipice, you can see
the spires of the Druid's Keep jutting forth from above the canopy.  There
is a strong sense of evil coming forth from that direction, though.  Do you
dare venture forth to smite the evil, or maybe even make it your own?

~

There is a cold breeze that blows from the north, chilling the air to a
frigid temperature.  A small path has begun to form here, leading off into
the west.  It seems as though a large type of animal has been scavenging for
food along the path here.  Several smaller bushes have been torn apart and
are devoid of small black berries.  They are easily recognizable as
Sharkroot Berries a key ingredient in the most deadly of poisons.

~

You are on a small path, a little ways away from the Druid's Keep which
is located to the northeast.  There doesn't seem to be any life in this area
of the forest at all.  It almost seems like it has been scared away or
killed.  Several small drops of dried blood have fallen onto the dirt of the
path and are beginning to blend in with the earthen tones of the
surroundings.  A small scrap of brown cloth is stuck to a Sharkroot bush
here.

A small branch from a tree in front of you has fallen across the footpath
here.  It is small enough that getting over it would not be a problem, but
part of the break looks almost as if it were a slice at the branch in the
attempt to fell it across the path.  The once green leaves, now browning,
lay scattered across the path where someone has cut across to the north.

As you continue deeper into the forest the canopy thickens and so do the
trees.  This is the older part of the forest, but you are still near to its
outer limits.  It seems as if the trees all sprouted up at once, and then
attempted to snuff out all other new life growing around them.  Of course,
this was in vain for life will prosper in the most unlikely of places, but
it seems to have taken its foothold slowly.

A Forest Clearing~
~
~
A large clearing has formed here in the depths of the forest.  Small
shrubs and low lying grass have taken a foothold here within it.  It looks
like a wonderful place for deer and other animals to graze quietly or sun in
the afternoon.  The path splits here in two directions: Heavy tracks lead
east, and a little used game trail to the west.

Boot prints trod to the east and west here, heavily in both directions. 
It looks like both humans and animals tread this path.  The bushes on the
side of the path have been rustled with the passing of human, demihuman, and
animal alike.  Stray shafts of light make it down to light your path as the
cool wind blows the branches of the canopy apart to allow it passage.

you to the fact that this could be a game trail.

see the occasional fish jump for a fly.  The creek runs north to south,

to poke out of the forest to the northeast.

You are walking on a small dirt path, tread by many before you.  The mud
is cracked and dried where the grass has been worn down by footsteps.  A
small purple flower has managed to poke through the mass of shrub and grass
on both sides of the trail.  Only one of the flower's buds actually reamains
open, the rest fallen into a small pile on the groud where the wind has
blown them around.

The Altar of Dolmaar~
~
~
You have entered a large clearing with a large stone block made of pure
white marble sitting in its exact center.  At closer inspection, this entire
clearing is an exact hemisphere.  The trees move in at just the right angle,
and dome over your head in that spherical shape that signifies purity.  The
white altar a perfect rectangle, pleasing to the eye.  The only mar in color
is on the ruts cut in the side to allow the blood to flow away from its
center.  Looking behind the altar is something not entirely out of place,
but different from the rest here.  It is a large golden oak, larger than
even the oldest of the trees in this forest.  Its branches high above the
canopy, letting the light fall down onto the altar where Dolmaar accepts his
sacrifices.

~

As you enter this section of the forest you notice that there is no noise
at all.  It is perfectly quiet here.  A large pool of the clearest water you
have ever seen sits undisturbed as glass.  On its edge is a large rock
overhanging it, and upon it sits a large leopard.  The leopard, basking in
the sun, lets a large stag walk by unnoticed.  This is a place of peace.

Darkness permeates your very soul in this dark place.  The howl of a wolf
grabs your attention, and it disappears into the darkness as quickly as it
came.  Time and time again the trail twists and turns, leading to dead ends
where the trees seem to consciously block your way and laugh.  From what you
can tell, the trail leads east and west, but reality is not always what it
seems.

sorts, with his wares spread out across the table.

Around the Boulder~

The path runs relatively straight here, passing past a large boulder. 
Bootprints are scattered all across the path, both coming and going.  This
path seems more well used the further you explore.

A Simple Dirt Path~
~
~
The path is remarkably dull.  If it weren't for the fact that it was
heading towards the Druid's Keep, perhaps nobody would travel it at all.  A
large boulder stands to the southwest, which is why the path curves around
it.

Before the Keep~
~

The fabled Druid's Keep stands before you in all its glory.  Made of
magnificent dark granite, it has stood the test of time.  Many years of
weathering leave an aged look upon the walls, covered in millenia of ivy. 
The sounds of a bustling community can be heard from where you stand,
hinting at the life inside.

Outside the West Wall~
~
~
The western wall of the Druid's Keep runs straight north.  The wall is
made of ancient granite, and when you bang upon it seems stronger than the
steel of your weapons.  The trail you follow seems to be less highly
travelled at this point, almost as if most people turned back by the time
they got this far.

Large wooden doors stand before you.  Carved on their front is the symbol
of the Druid God, Dolmaar.  They seem to have lasted centuries, perhaps
millenia.  There is a rock sitting just off of the path, worn by weather
throughout the years.  It looks as if it would make a wonderful seat.  The
walls of the keep are covered in ivy all around, but it is oily and almost
impossible to climb.

You have walked into the grand entrace of the Druid's Keep!  This
building is even more stunning on the inside than it was on the outside. 
The dark granite gives way to elegant, but simple, white marble.  A
chandeleir with hundreds of candles burns above your head.  The walls are
covered with tapestries and mosaics depicting the createion of the world by
Dolmaar, and the banishment of evil.  The floor is carpeted with thick
eastern rugs, soft even through your adventuring boots.  This place is truly
awe inspiring.

together so wonderfully that you cannot notice them unless you stare
intently at the wall.  The detailed carvings on the stones are quite
intricate as well.  Close up you notice they are all Druidic runes, and from
further back it is distinguishable that the wall is a large prayer to
Dolmaar.

stands on, before it was built upon.  The landscape and forest look

of security to the Keep at the same time.  On the window frame you notice a
tatter piece of robe, with the word 'ShElNyaan' painted on it.

tapestries or pictures.  No large cendelabras keeping the hall lit.  No
windows to see the outside.  It is as if this section of the hall was

The hallway here is wide, but two large Druids stand in the middle of it.
Most people passing by attempt to walk around them, but end up jostling them

here most days and chat in the same spot and traffic continually goes
around.

seems that the giant spiral staircase has collapsed and has blocked further

A Wondrous Garden~
~
~
The garden that surrounds you is very neat and tidy.  All the weeds have
been pulled, and the color schemes make for a very nice presentation.  As
you survey your surroundings, a small hummingbird buzzes past your ear to a
flower and quickly flies away.

The Garden~
~
~
The scent of tulips softly wanders to your nose, almost as sweet as the
scent of the roses.  As you walk along the paths, a small squirrel runs
across your path and evades your footsteeps.  If you did not know you were
in the Keep, it would seem this was a beautiful outdoor grove.

~

You stand in the center of the Druids' inner courtyard.  The entire area
is covered in a lavish garden.  In front of you stands the centerpiece of
the entire place, a large crystal fountain bubbling forth with water crystal
clear.  Small streams of water pour out of the fountain and travel to other
parts of the garden.

~

A winding path slithers through the garden like a snake.  The working of
the garden makes the path seem natural, and it does not interfere with the
look at all.  All around there are small pedestals with water in them; the
birds taking baths within them.

warm, moreso than the rest of the garden.  You can feel the magics of this

is the orchid that stands out above the rest.

given way to hard, simple marble.  There is little decoration here, to make
the statue stand out that much more.  The eyes of the statue stare down at
the ground, seemingly focused upon you.  For some reason there seems to be
an air of uneasiness around, eminating from the statue.  It is only a
statue, right?

the hall makes a sharp turn.  In the corner a dark shape stands wearing a
black robe that the Druids wear.  As you attempt to get closer you seem to
be blocked by an unseen barrier.  Most likely a display piece.

the passage of a person or creature along the floor or walls.

drop from the corridor just to the east.

take hours to replace and light all of them.  The carpet gradually changes
from a dark blue at the east and west to a dark red, which seems to run
underneath the door.

hundreds of different jars sitting upon shelves.  The spell components of
the mighty druid Dlraxor must be giving off this horrid stench.  Your eyes
take heed of the large desk carved of solid oak here.  It seems to be
stained black, red, yellow and other colours upon its surface; most likely
from the many spells that Dlraxor attempts here.  Underneath the desk is a
beautiful carpet which depicts a glorious rendition of the Keep from an
aerial view.  You notice the five points of a pentagram protuding forth from
under the carpet.

A Dead End~
~
~
You have reached a dead end in the hall.  The dust here seems less thick
than in other places, almost as if it has been disturbed recently.  You see
no footprints or other markings to verify that fact, though.  The walls on
the sides are the smooth stone you are used to seeing in the Keep.  The
block in the north is rough and jagged as if hastily made.

A Hidden Library~
~
~
You have stumbled upon the great library of the Druids.  This is where
they hide all the books they have found, or written, which contain knowledge
that should be kept away from the world.  The writings contained here could
be used to destroy the world, if in the wrong hands.  Unfortunately,
everything seems to be written in the ancient tongue of the Druids which you
are unable to read.

You stand just east of the large double doors guarding something that you
do not know.  There is no carpet here, strange considering there is
everywhere else that you seem to remember.  The stone on the floor looks
worn from passage over time, also strange since most of the keep looks as if
it is brand new.

collapsed.  The whole place groans as if it may collapse on top of you.

over the tumbled rocks of the northern wall.  The splashing tide joins at
the bottom of the wall with the unsavory stream which runs into this room
from the south and flows out through a crevice in the room's north west
corner.  The majority of the room has been cleared of any debris which may
have resulted from the collapse of the northern wall, however the structure
does not appear to have been reinforced after the cave in and still seems
shaky at best.  The sickening stench of evil and decay assault you from the

to lack any sort of seam.  Your breath mists the air before you as the cold
tries to creep into your bones.  To the west, the tunnel intersects with the
others which form the catacombs.  To the east, the tunnel continues on, into

&RThe Catacombs~
~
~
The sucking, wet sounds of your footfalls echo strangely as you wander
through the catacombs.  The ceiling and walls seem to pull in around you as
you walk, their jagged surfaces seeming ready to crush you at any moment. 
Your light source creates shifting movement all around, constantly pulling
your eyes to the shadows.

You've come to a bend in the tunnel.  It is particularly dark, wet and
slimy here.  The corner is obstructed by a large slab of stone which appears
to have fallen through the ceiling.  It looks like a tight squeeze, but it
looks like you can make it.

There is muck everywhere here.  Foul looking moulds and sickly green
slimes grow everywhere.  The air can hardly be called warm, but it is not so
firgid as in the central sections of the catacombs.  Condensation collects
everywhere, running down the walls, and occasionally dripping on your head.

The air is thick with humidity here.  Warm air from the east mixes with
cooler air from the west creating a localized fog, which coupled with the
darkness makes it almost impossible to see.  The ground here is spongy and
soft.  Closer inspection reveals a healthy carpet of moss.  Only a very
small trickle of water runs along the floor through the moss.  This must be
one of the sources of the stream which runs east of here, and along the
north-south corridor of the catacombs.

supports only sporratic fungal growth.  It is quite warm here, though not
unpleasant.  The breeze blows softly past, around the bend and towards the

You stand at the base of a sheer stone wall which rises into the inky
blackness above.  To your left and your right it stretches well beyond the
globe of illumination cast by your light source.  Directly in front of you,
a strange door seems the only breech in the otherwise glassy smooth surface.
The door itself is made of semi-lusterous metal embossed at odd intervals
with runes.  The runes it seems are the source of the green light which can
be seen from the south.  They dance with contained green fire, as do those
which adorn the arched door frame.  The writhing green light seems to lend a
life to the wards, almost making them seem to shift and writh as well.

bottom large enough to slide food in and out.  You notice scratch marks
everywhere here, like the tenant has been trying to escape for some time
now.  You can see what seems to be bones and half eaten human corpses in the
northeast corner.

You stand in a dark corridor west of the tunnels' crossing.  The floor
here has an oddly bubbled texture, almost as if the floor had at one point
been molten stone, hot and bubbling, then suddenly flash cooled.  The walls
are smooth and slick with condensation.  The roof is low, barely clearing
your head.  You are forced to bend low at regular intervals to pass below
what appear to be wooden support frames.  Closer inspection of the frames
shows you that either they were carved by extremely skilled stone workers,
or the frames have been petrified by something since their installation.

of the wind which runs through the north-south tunnel of the catacombs.

low limits.  To the north and east the stone seems to flow away from this
geiser, making passage on foot extremely difficult, dangerous, and slow
going.

Stone, the consistency of melted wax, forms the floor to this passage
way.  The crevices between the flows of stone now gather the dampness of the
air into new flows of cool water.  The stone of the walls and ceiling seem
to be single, seemless, glassy pieces of stone as has been the case the
entire length of the passage.  To the south, at the edge of your light's
reach you can see a bend in the tunnel which then leads east.  To the north
the passage stretches off into the inky blackness.

anything but stone.  If the door is indeed still of any use, it must open
inwards as the stone flow is obviously well above the bottom of solid oak
structure.

through the unnaturally smooth stone.  Smooth, that is, with the exception
of the stone floor which has a tumultuous look, as though it had once been a
rushing flow of liquid granite which froze solid even as it boiled.  A low
fog obscures much of the detail of the stone floor which, coupled with the
small streams and pools of water which have collected along the hall, makes
for very treacherous footing.

trickle into here from every direction leading you to wonder if there might
be an outlet somewhere at the bottom.  To the west, the catacombs' western
passage stands open before you.  To the east, beyond the crumbled wreckage a
long collapsed wall lies a cavernous opening who's true dimensions you can
only guess at from here.

upper reaches of the cavern.  They come seemingly from nowhere and sound as
though they may continue forever.

snickering.  To the west the cavern opens up into a larger chamber.  A
doorway seemingly swirled together out of the granite of the wall and veins
of highly lusterous copper bars your passage to the east.  Runes adorn the
the door at irregular intervals and are likewise spread around the doorframe
which looks much like the petrified support beams near the beginning of this
tunnel.  The runes dance with a dark energy which seems to draw in and feed
upon the glow of your light source.

master, albeit slowly.  One wrong move could mean the training master takes
off your head.

&RThe Training Grounds~
~
~
A putrid smell comes from this corner of the training grounds.  It seems
this is where the dead, and the dying, are put.  Little mercy is given to
those who cannot help themselves.  Injuries are nursed by ones self here, or
you are dragged on the pile to serve as a reminder of failure.

&RThe Essence of Magic~
~
~
You enter a large room that seems much too big for what you believe could
fit underneath this mountain.  Lined upon the walls are jars, vials, and
small cages all around.  Larger cages with strange, fantastical beasts are
scattered upon the floor in various states of life, death, and undeath. 
Flying around in the air, so far above, it seems like a flock of bats...  Or
worse.

&RThe Entrance To Magic~
~
~
An eerie silence surrounds you in this room.  The walls look black with
soot, and blood.  The ground is caked with substances it is hard to put a
name to.  Every step you take you expect to echo, but it somehow doesn't.  
A small river of blood flows North.

&RHoly Ground~
~
~
You find yourself in a small cave, but the holy power eminating from it
is immense.  A small pool of water has gathered on the ground, and a
pedestal with a small flask stands out from the middle.  Despite the lack of
light down here, it seems as if daylight has somehow seeped through the
ground.

An Old Cavern~
~
~
The walls are sticky and wet in your new destination, and look as though
they were carved by an ancient stream.  You smell something acidic nearby,
but can't place your finger on what it is exactly.  The only light entering
the room despite your own is the glowing portal on the south wall, leading
back to the Catacombs.

A Dried Up Streambed~
~
~
You've come to the bank of the old streambed that carved this cavern out.
There is a slight drop of about three or four feet between where you are and
the center of the stream.  The whole path looks about ten feet across in
total.  You are starting to see some vegetation growing in the sediment left
behind by the old water.

A Dried Up Streambed~
~
~
The moss and lichen hangs from the low ceiling making your passage tough.
The hanging vegitation is clumped in curtain-like patches which makes
passage difficult.  A hole or a stone could be hiding to trip and injure
you.  As best you can tell, the bed continues in an East-West direction.

A Sharp Decline~
~
~
You are following an old dried up streambed through the large cavern. 
Old growths of moss and strange ferns have sprouted up making your path
difficult.  The life down here is amazing considering the lack of light. 
The heat and humidity are stifling down here!  The streambed takes a sharp
vertical dip, coming close to straight down.

The Dark Stairwell~
~
~
There are rough steps here leading up.  The old stream bed that you have
been following took a sharp drop here.  Someone, or something, has chiseled
out steps.  They are nowhere near flat, and there are remnants of greenish
ooze that sizzles upon your armor when it splashes up.  The cave continues
on to the West, your light cannot penetrate the darnkess to tell more than
it is a large cavern.

&RThe Serpent's Lair~
~
~
You have wandered into the Serpent's Lair, and have discovered why it is
called such.  The evidence of a dragon being here is unmistakable!  Large
piles of treasure here and there, corpses scattered across the ground, and
monstrous scales shed off!  The stink of dragon is everywhere, and its aura
of presence can be felt as you step into the room.  The only exit is the way
that you came in.
