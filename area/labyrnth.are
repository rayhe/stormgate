wolfen~
a wolfen~
A wolfen jumps out of the darkness, it's claws aimed for your throat!
~
The wolfen is obviously a magical creature.  About the size of a normal
wolf, it has been horribly changed.  Its legs seem longer than a normal
wolf's, and appear to have an extra joint.  Several claws, each as long as a
man's finger, glisten wetly with the poison that the wolfen secreets.  The
jaws of the wolfen are huge as well, crammed full of more teeth than would
be possible in nature.  Perhaps the most frightening feature of the wolfen
is the almost human intelligence that peers at you through yellow eyes.  You
get the feeling that the wolfen is looking at you like most hunters look at
a rabbit.

gholam~
a gholam~
A gholam shuffles out of the darkness, its eyeless head searching you out.
~
The pale mannequin before you is the most disgustion creature in the
Labyrinth.  They were created long ago as undead golems, but for some reason
gained a horrible semblance of life: the could reproduce.  Such offspring
were of similar appearance to their undead ancestors, with pale, bloodless
skin and slow gait.  But there the differences ended.  While undead have
limited mental facilities, the gholam possess many mental powers.  These
powers make up for a large physical deformity the gholam have: they are born
blind.  But that does not stop them from being the fiercest creature in the
Labyrinth.

phade phantom ghost~
a phade~
A phade looms before you, its blade solidifying as it swings for your neck!
~
Very little is known about phades.  While they have been 'seen' before,
no one has been able to provide an accurate description.  Believed to come
from one of the demi-planes, phades are thought to be able to dematerialize
at will, allowing them to flow through walls and other objects.  For some
unknown reason however, this ability does not allow them to change shape. 
Phades always have the general form of a humanoid, complete with armor and
weapons that change consistancy as the phade does.  Phades are dark
creatures, wearing black and blending well with the night, and possessing
all of the abilities that 'normal' nocturnal creature do.

spirit lost mad wind~
the Mad Wind~
The Mad Wind howls out of the darkness.
~
Only the legends speak of the Mad Wind.  One of the inhabitants of the
outer planes, the Mad Wind feeds off of fear and suffering.  Apparently, the
Labyrinth is rich in such feelings for it to become its home.  The Wind is
difficult to look at; it seems solid one moment and indistinct the next. 
That is, when it can be seen at all.

lich renu fal terra~
the lich of Renu~
The animated corpse of Renu looks at you, then leaps to attack!
~
The corpse of Renu has not aged well.  Strips of flesh, where not
entirely missing from his body, are wrinkled and grey.  An odour of decay
emanates from his body, nearly making you gag.  The lich of Renu would be
indistinguishable from a normal zombie except for the angry red glow that
shines from his empty eye sockets.

doom guard~
a doom guard~
A doom guard stands silently, waiting for your response.
~
The doom guard before appears to be a man wearing a suit of black armor. 
However, that is not so, for when you look into its open visor, you see
nothing but a firey red glow where its eyes should be.  The doom guard also
moves slower than a normal person would, as if it was not exactly sure of
how each part of its body relates to the others.  Aside from open visor,
there is no other chinks in the guards armor.

mist demon monster~
a mist demon~
The small winged shape of a mist demon floats by in the grey fog.
~
Small and weak are two adjectives that have often been used to describe
mist demons.  With tiny horns and puny wings, these creatures seem laughable
when compared to their large, more fiercesome cousins.  They are so weak
that they cannot survive outside of the Grey Mists, and must wander here for
all eternity.  However, this does give them some advantages.  Their grey
skins blend perfectly with the fog, making them difficult to see.  As well,
mist demons are excellent tricksters, and have been known to cause many
people to become lost in this realm with them.

gold golem~
a golden golem~
The gold golem attacks you, the light reflecting brightly off its skin.
~
This golem is shaped like a normal humanoid, if not a little more
squarish.  Rivets of steel can be easily seen on it, holding the gold plates
that make up its skin together.  The gold golem has small emeralds as eyes,
and even a ruby carved like lips for a mouth.  It seems harmless, but when
you look at its hands you notice that each edge has been sharpened to razor
thiness.  Obviously, the gold golem was not meant to be just an ornament.

lesser demon kazarath~
a small green demon~
A small demon hisses at you, its green fur standing on end.
~
This small green demon seems to be quite excited.  It flitters from place
to place, unable to stay still for even a short period of time. 
Unfortunately, it looks quite strange doing this, with its long green fur
and puny wings.  Its yellow eyes, slitted like those of a cat's, glare at
you warrily when you look at it.  There is no doubt in your mind that this
demon would try to destroy you if it was not restrained.

demon red Vassago~
a small red demon~
A small red demon glances at you and yawns.
~
The demon before you is quite a fearsome creature.  Its red fur covers
its entire body, making it look dangerous.  Long black horns and sharp teeth
also help its appearance, with a tail and wings ending off the typical
description of a demon.  There the similarities end though.  While demons
are portrayed as dumb creatures, this one looks at you with an intelligence
that is somehow more than human.  The small grin on its face makes you
believe that its amused by what its looking at.

Protector~
The Protector turns its head slowly to stare at you as you enter.
~
Standing at least twice the height of a normal humanoid, the Guardian
must weigh a thousand pounds.  Constructed of black granite, the Guardian is
covered with glowing runes that animate him.  You get the feeling that the
Guardian has no emotions, and will therefore never attack you.

The black granite walls of this room are natural depositories for
shadows, making the room seem larger than it really is.  The logs in the
fireplace burn brightly, sending heat throughout the room, yet the wood
never seems to diminish.  The room is empty, except for a few pieces of
paper.  Apparently, Rune has moved.  Feel free to re-desc.

A Rocky Path~
~
~
You appear to be in a land of black rock.  All around you, as far as you
can see, lie chunks of black granite embedded in the barren ground.  Some of
the smaller pieces could be called boulders, but the larger ones are nearly
the size of a house.  Such a profusion of dark rock can only be magical; the
large black building ahead of you only confirms this suspicion.  The path
that you are following winds in between boulders, stopping at the huge
wooden gate that marks the entrance to the Labyrinth.  A small plaque,
unrusted despite its age, has been attached somehow to a nearby boulder.

Before the Gate~
~

A huge black wall stretches to the east and west of you.  Made of the
same black granite that predominates the area, the wall seems impregnable. 
Add to that the glowing sigla that entirely cover the wall, and you have a
structure that is meant to last until the end of time.  A huge gate set into
the wall appears to be the only entrance.  Some words seem to have been
carved into the stone above the door.  The entire area emanates a sense of
foreboding, nearly making you want to flee.  Aside from entering the
Labyrinth, the only other way to leave the area is to the south.

In the Labyrinth~
~
~
You stand in the deserted halls of the Labyrinth.  The magical darkness
of this place makes it hard for you to see the walls of the passage on
either side of you.  The ceiling is low as well, which when combined with
the narrow hall, makes you feel slightly claustrophobic.  The inside of the
Labyrinth is made of the same black rock that the outer wall was made of,
although no magical symbols adorn the walls of this grim place.  The dust on

You stand in the deserted halls of the Labyrinth.  The magical darkness
of this place makes it hard for you to see the walls of the passage on
either side of you.  The ceiling is low as well, which when combined with
the narrow hall, makes you feel slightly claustrophobic.  The inside of the
Labyrinth is made of the same black rock that the outer wall was made of,
although no magical symbols adorn the walls of this grim place.  The dust on
the floor is not thick, considering how long it has been since the Labyrinth
has been sealed.  However, in the grime that has accumulated, you notice the

This section of the Labyrinth is different than the rest of it.  The most
obvious change is the return of light.  Glowing symbols cover the wall,
their feeble illumination making it slightly easier to see.  Strangely
enough though, their light reaches the boundries of the room and stops
abruptly.  An archway in the southern wall leads to a set of stairs, their
bottom shrouded in darkness.  Something has been carved into the rock above
the arch.  The only other exit from the room is to the north, into the maze
of the Labyrinth.

The magical darkness does not prevent you from seeing the majesty of the
Great Stair.  Constructed of the same black granite that the rest of the
Labyrinth is made of, the Great Stair seems less sinister than the rest of
the Labyrinth.  Wide enough to allow passage for twenty men, the Stair
echoes forlornly with your footsteps.  Perhaps, eons ago, the High Wizard
walked down these steps as she visited her father's resting place one last
time.  If she did however, her passage has long since been covered by the
thick coating of dust that lies all around you.  The dust is not completely
undisturbed: many of the Labyrinth's inhabitants have left their tracks here
as they have climbed or descended these steps.  The stairs continue their
trek into darkness to the east.  Above you awaits the first level of the

Great Stair.  Constructed of the same black granite that the rest of the
Labyrinth is made of, the Great Stair seems less sinister than the rest of
the Labyrinth.  Wide enough to allow passage for twenty men, the Stair
echoes forlornly with your footsteps.  Perhaps, eons ago, the High Wizard
walked down these steps as she visited her father's resting place one last
time.  If she did however, her passage has long since been covered by the
thick coating of dust that lies all around you.  The dust is not completely
undisturbed: many of the Labyrinth's inhabitants have left their tracks here
as they have climbed or descended these steps.  You feel a slight breeze
stirring the air, making you think that you are close to the bottom.  Exits
lead downwards to the east, and upwards above you.

make out where the floor straightens; the darkness prevents you from seeing
more.  Somewhere above you, at the other end of the steps, lies the first
floor of the Labyrinth.

At the Stairs~
~

The room you are stnading in is similar to the one at the top of the
stairs.  Magical symbols on the black granite walls provide dim
illumination.  The same state of uncleanliness is abound here as well: dust,
ages old, lies everywhere.  The only exits are to the south and up, each of
which is shrouded in a magical darkness making it impossible to see what
lies in that direction.

The Halls of the Dead~
~

You are surrounded by darkness, only barely able to see a few feet in
front of you.  What you can see does not seem very encouraging: black stone
walls that dully reflect light back at you; the tracks of many creatures in
the eon old dust on the floor.  There are more noises on this level than
others.  You can hear occasional bumps in the darkness, as if something
was trying to move around stealthily.  A slight breeze moans through the
deserted halls, sounding like the spirits of a thousand dead.  However you
find that the most disturbing thing is not the thick blackness that
surrounds you, but rather the faint glimmers of light that can be seen
farther down the hall periodically, making you think that you will soon find
the source of the tracks.  Exits lead in all directions.

You are surrounded by darkness, only barely able to see a few feet in
front of you.  What you can see does not seem very encouraging: black stone
walls that dully reflect light back at you; the tracks of many creatures in
the eon old dust on the floor.  There are more noises on this level than
others.  You can hear occasional bumps in the darkness, as if something was
trying to move around stealthily.  A slight breeze moans through the
deserted halls, sounding like the spirits of a thousand dead.  However you
find that the most disturbing thing is not the thick blackness that
surrounds you, but rather the faint glimmers of light that can be seen
farther down the hall periodically, making you think that you will soon find
the source of the tracks.  The dingy corrider you are in continues to the
east and west.

The Halls of the Dead~

You are surrounded by darkness, only barely able to see a few feet in
front of you.  What you can see does not seem very encouraging: black stone
walls that dully reflect light back at you; the tracks of many creatures in
the eon old dust on the floor.  There are more noises on this level than
others.  You can hear occasional bumps in the darkness, as if something was
trying to move around stealthily.  A slight breeze moans through the
deserted halls, sounding like the spirits of a thousand dead.  However you
find that the most disturbing thing is not the thick blackness that
surrounds you, but rather the faint glimmers of light that can be seen
farther down the hall periodically, making you think that you will soon find
the source of the tracks.  The passage splits here, with exits to the north,
east and west leading into darkness.

At the Stairs of Light~
~
~
This room is like any other part of the Labyrinth except for one thing:
the door.  Entirely filling an arch laid into the wall, the door is at least
twice the height that you are.  Made of the same black granite that the rest
of the Labyrinth is constructed of, the door only has one symbol carved on
it, as if to contrast the the many glowing sigla on the walls of this room. 
The light from these sigla extends to the edge of the room, then stops, held
back by some unseeable magical force.  Something has been carved into the
arch above the door.  Aside from the door, the only other exit is to the
north.

On the Stairs of Light~
~

It is obvious that the maker of the Labyrinth had a small sense of humor.
Far from being well lit, as the name would imply, the Stairs of Light are
nearly as dank as the rest of the Labyrinth.  Sigla, glowing softly despite
their age, carved on wall barely provide enough light for you to keep your
footing.  There is enough light to show you one thing though: this portion
of the Labyrinth has been unused for centuries - at least by anything with
feet.  The dust lies all around you, thick and unbroken, except for your
footprints.  The Stairs of Light are more silent than the levels above you,
with only your footsteps to remind you that you are not dead.  But, as you
have often learned, silence can hide many things.  The stairway continues
downwards to the east, and above you is the Halls of the Dead.

Down in the Pit~
~
~
As you step over the threshold of this part of the hall, you notice one
very strange thing: there is no floor.  You fall down the pit, trying
desperately to grab onto something to slow your descent.  Unfortunately, the
walls are just as smooth as elsewhere in the Labyrinth, so you are unable to
find anything.  You land on the floor of the pit with a loud thump, not
doing any serious damage to yourself Luckily, the bottom was not far from
the top, which is a few lengths above your head.  Deciding that you will
never be able to climb back out, you look around the small room hunting for
a way to escape.  You find one quite easily: a large man-made tunnel runs
east, leading to unknown portions of the Labyrinth.

A Mist Shrouded Room~
~
~
The room that you stand in is similar to all the other parts of the
Labyrinth: bare and dusty.  This room is slightly different though.  Where
all the other rooms were made with black granite, this one has been made
with grey marble.  Or at least that is what you think until you get a closer
look at the walls.  You then realize that it is the same black granite as
elsewhere, and that it is only mist coming out of a doorway to the south
that makes the room look grey.  Aside from the fog enshrouded doorway, the
only other exit from this room is up the Stairs of Light.  A small plaque
has been inserted into one wall here.

In the Grey Mists~
~
~
You do not know if you are falling or flying.  The grey mist that
surrounds you distorts your senses, making it difficult to determine which
way is up, much less if you are moving in a particular direction.  The fog
swirls around you, seeping into your every pore and making you shiver,
although it is not cold or damp.  The mist makes itself seem to extend in
all directions forever; and for all you know about this place, it may.  It
is said that the Grey Mists are one of the demi-planes where the demons
begin their existance.  You hope that this is not true, for the dark fog
could hide a million demons without your knowledge.  To the north of you,
appears to be a door floating in the mist, with no apparent support.  In all
other directions lies the mist.

all directions forever; and for all you know about this place, it may.  It
is said that the Grey Mists are one of the demi-planes where the demons
begin their existance.  You hope that this is not true, for the dark fog
could hide a million demons without your knowledge.  Mist lies around you in
all directions.

In the Grey Mists~

You do not know if you are falling or flying.  The grey mist that
surrounds you distorts your senses, making it difficult to determine which
way is up, much less if you are moving in a particular direction.  The fog
swirls around you, seeping into your every pore and making you shiver,
although it is not cold or damp.  The mist makes itself seem to extend in

A Mist Shrouded Room~
~
~
The black granite walls of this room are hard to see with all the mist in
this room.  It flows out of a door to the north, pouring out as if it came
from a never ending supply.  It makes it difficult to walk in this room, so
that you nearly fall down the stairs when you come to them.  Aside from the
door leading into the grey fog to the north, the stairs are the only exit
from the room, their bottom hidden in darkness.

Before the Burial Chamber~
~
~
This room seems more grandoise than the rest of the Labyrinth somehow:
larger, more imposing.  Yet overlaid with this feeling of completion, there
is also a sense of peacefulness that permeates the room.  Perhaps it is
because of the stillness.  No breeze wails through this room, nor do any
noises break the silence.  Tall stone pillars stretch upwards, their tops
lost in darkness.  Aside from the stairs, the only other exit is to the
south, through a large granite door, above which something seems to have
been carved.

The Burial Chamber of Renu Fal-Terra~
~
~
The burial chamber has lain undisturbed for eons.  As you enter, you can
still see the footprints of the last person to enter - the tracks of Merra
Mal-Renu are plainly visible in the thick dust.  The room only has one
adornment: a huge stone casket, constructed out of the same black granite of
the rest of the Labyrinth is, lies in the exact center of the room.  A red
sigil glows brightly on the lid of the casket, unbroken despite its age. 
The only exit from this room is the door to the north.

At the Stairs of Light~

This room is like any other part of the Labyrinth except for one thing:
the door.  Entirely filling an arch laid into the wall, the door is at least
twice the height that you are.  Made of the same black granite that the rest
of the Labyrinth is constructed of, the door only has one symbol carved on
it, as if to contrast the many glowing sigla on the walls of this room.  The
dim glow from these sigla extends to the edge of the room, then stops, help
back be some unseeable magical force.  Aside from the door, the only other
exit from this room is to the north.

On the Stairs of Light~

It is obvious that the maker of the Labyrinth had a small sense of humor.
Far from being well lit, as the name would imply, the Stairs of Light are
nearly as dank as the rest of the Labyrinth.  Sigla, glowing softly despite
their age, carved on wall barely provide enough light for you to keep your
footing.  There is enough light to show you one thing though: this portion
of the Labyrinth has been unused for centuries - at least by anything with
feet.  The dust lies all around you, thick and unbroken, except for your
footprints.  The Stairs of Light are more silent than the levels above you,
with only your footsteps to remind you that you are not dead.  But, as you
have often learned, silence can hide many things.  The stairs lead downwards
to the east, and end directly above you.

The black granite walls that surround you are like any other portion of
the Labyrinth except for one thing: there have been magical symbols engraved
on them.  All of the sigla are exactly the same, and they each give of a dim
glow.  The light reveals a state of dustiness similar to all the other
floors but for one thing.  Any markings you make in this dust disappear
after a few seconds wait, effectivly wiping out your trail.  A small plaque
has been attached to the wall, and something has been carved above the arch
leading to the stairs.  The only other exit from this room is to the south.

The sigla that surround you provide dim light, showing you a grim scene. 
Where the halls above you were merely repetitive, these are exactly the

Even the magical symbols are exactly alike, each one exuding the same amount
of light.  There are no breezes; no echoes or sudden shifts in temperature
to help you decide if you have been in this part of the hall already or not.
The only sign that you are moving at all is the steady ache that has been
growing in your legs: you would only feel this tired after walking quite
some ways.  The only exits are to the north and south.

some ways.  The only exits are to the north and south.

The Halls of Illusion~
~
~
The sigla that surround you provide dim light, showing you a grim scene. 
Where the halls above you were merely repetitive, these are exactly the
same.  Footprints that you leave in the dust disappear after a few steps. 
Even the magical symbols are exactly alike, each one exuding the same amount
of light.  There are no breezes; no echoes or sudden shifts in temperature
to help you decide if you have been in this part of the hall already or not.

At the Stairs~
~
~
You stand at the top of a flight of stairs, the bottom of which are
shrouded in darkness.  The light from the sigla carved on the walls do not
reach down any further than the first few steps, as if it was held back by
some unseen barrier.  Aside from that however, this room is much the same as
any other part of the Labyrrinth, with black granite walls and centuries of
dust on the floor.  The only exits from this room is the hall to the north,
and the stairs leading down.

The Vault of Renu Fal-Terra~
~
~
Magical darkness surrounds you once again, making it difficult to see. 
You can barely make out the black stone walls around you.  Suprisingly, the
floors here are dust free, as if the Labyrinth actually cared about what lay
in these rooms.  Or, as if something was here to clean the area.  The only
exits are to the south and up the stairs above you.

The Vault of Renu Fal-Terra~
~
~
This room appears to be a dead end.  Black stone walls surround you on
three sides, each with no apparent opening.  It is only when you take a
closer look that you notice how the walls are highly polished, and each has
a silver faceplate with a small keyhole in it.  This room is different than
other rooms.  Pillars, made of the same black rock, stretch upwards
supporting a high ceiling that not even the magical darkness can hide.  The
floor remains dust free, whether by mechanical of magical means you know
not.  Aside from the three locked doors, the only exit is to the north.

The Vault of Renu Fal-Terra~
~
~
This room seems like it should not belong in the Labyrinth at all.  It is
ablaze with the light from hundreds of sigla inscribed on the wall.  While
looking at the walls is nearly impossible, you can tell by squinting that
they are constructed of the same black granite that the rest of the
Labyrinth is.  While the room seems like it was designed to hold something
important, it does not, for the room is bare.  Except for one thing...

The only furnishing in this room is the black stone box that sits in the
exact center of the room, as if to draw your attention.  The only exit from
this room is to the north.
