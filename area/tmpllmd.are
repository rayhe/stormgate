A Dark Underworld~
~
~
You are in a dark underworld, surrounded by shadows, ruled by lies and
survived through deceit.  There is an immediate sense that a hundred eyes
are watching you from every direction and every corner.  The walls, ceilings
and floors are a simple black, no decorations and no other coloring.  The only
source of light are two torches stuck on the walls on either side of you.
You can't shake this feeling that everything is not what it seems, that
everything in this area has a deeper, darker story behind it.
Type HELP CHANNELS to join channels and to ask for help on them.  Vulgar
language is ONLY permitted on the mutter channel.

Edge of a Cliff~
~
~
As you enter, glancing around you, you almost miss the fact that the
platform you are standing on suddenly drops off to what seems like a
bottomless abyss.  All around you, you can hear a soft, but consistent
cackling.  The platform you walk on is not rock, but smooth, cold steel
plating.  As you walk around, you can definitely hear the small
clitter-clatter of other footsteps around you but cannot determine their
origin.  It is quite disconcerting.  To the east, although the platform has
ended, a wood plank bridge connects over the abyss to the other side.  There
is also a set of small stairs leading downward.  If you venture to the EAST
you will fing The Spirit Of Terlkian ever so helpful.  If you venture 2 DOWN
and go either NORTH or WEST you will find a couple of shops and the REMORT
master Dubv.

On a Wood Plank Bridge~
~
~
You step on this bridge with a great deal of trepidation as you are unsure
about the bridge's stability.  There is tremendous sway from right to left
and every step feels like you might fall through the gaps between planks.
A string of lights lines each plank, providing minimal lighting for you to
realize the bridge path.  With every step you seem to get a little bit closer,
yet there is still an eternity of bridge to cross.  Bright lights catch your
eye on the other side.  You can either go back or keeping going forward.

Beginning of a Path~
~
~
After a grueling adventure over the wood-plank bridge, you have finally
reached the other side.  A path begins here, emphasized by the dark blue carpet
extending to the east.  The room is unusual as it is extremely bright,
accented by hundreds of fluorescent lights.  It exudes a feeling of clarity,
truth and warmth.  Be very careful and recognize what this area is.  Nothing
is what it seems around here and everything must be scrutinized with a
watchful eye.  A steel ornament representing a cascading waterfall sits in 
corner of the room.  A thick black fluid flows down the waterfall and it
does not seem safe to touch.

Forkroad in the Path of Deceit~
~
~
It is clear you must exercise some of your decision making skills at this
point.  The Path of Deceit has ended here and forks off to the east and to
the south.  From the east, you can hear considerable commotion from a dimly
lit room hidden behind shiny black beads.  The path to the south appear to
end, but it is uncertain from this distance.  On the floor a large two-headed
serpent has been painted, with one head pointing in either direction.  The
head toward the east seems peaceful and non-threatening while the one to the
south seems pre-occupied and trying to say something to you.

A Shady Refuge~
~
~
While you feel you can safely rest in this dimly lit alcove, it is not
possible to reach a state of complete relaxation.  Shadows cross the room
from every direction although the source of these shadows are not always clear.
A state of ebony carved in the likeness of Terlikan, a deity of Manipulation,
stands over 5 feet tall in the middle of the room.  A small radius around
the statue has been roped off, but a powerful magic reaches every corner and
crack of this resting place.  People push each other out of the way to get
a little closer to the statue, believing the closer you are, the stronger
you can get.

Hall of Rumors~
~

Entering this room, a sudden rush of voices and whispering overruns your
ears.  The room is extremely windy and it only serves to carry the voices
even further and amplifies them even louder.  The draft seems to be entering
from a small manhole shaped opening in the ground.  There is no covering and
a ladder has been placed against the opening leading downward.  Several large
wolf pelts decorate the walls of this room.

Behind the desk sits a large troll speaking hundreds of various languages to
the students sitting in these chairs.  You may learn langauges here.  For

This staircase proceeds further downwards wrapping around a gigantic glass
tube filled with water.  It seems to be an aquarium of sorts.  At this level
you can see some of goldfish and pirahna's preying on the other tiny fish.
Eels and stingrays float around battling for the top of the food chain.  The
tubular aquarium has a blue glow originating from the bottom of the aquarium.

Twisting Staircase~

You have almost reached the bottom of the staircase.  The lights have become
even brighter at this level, almost blinding you.  Adjusting to the bright
lighting, you can see a hallway breaking off to the west.  A dark pool of water
sits in a fountain and flows down into a drain in the floor.  The water from
the fountain originates from a huge anaconda statuette mounted right above
the pool of water.  Looking north, you see a small crawl space just large
enough for someone to get through on their hands and knees.

A Small Shaft~
~
~
There is barely enough room for you to even breathe.  Any bigger and you would
definitely be stuck in the shaft.  Fortunately, it seems that the shaft ends
pretty soon, although you have to crawl through at least another segment to
the west before you can get out.  The shaft is encased in a thick layer of
dust, wreaking havoc on those with severe allergies.  Rats scurry about,
crawling through your legs and right by you, not showing one bit of fear.
You can make out the faint smell of food somewhere in the distance.

You have entered the room of the Class Master Dubv. This room is rather odd as it is neither rectangular
nor square. There is no feeling of comfort in this room especially when Dubv glances over you and grins.
There is a bookshelf behind Dubv and there appears to be a little light comming from the crack where
the door meets the actual case. You try not to look as you fear Dubv might notice and wonder if you
would try something to take a peek.

So there is light at the end of the tunnel!  This appears to be the last
segment of the shaft and to the west you can clearly make out a full sized
room.  The smell of food and nourishment continues to get stronger and
stronger, making your stomach rumble.  A small grill is right beneath you
on the bottom of the shaft, but you cannot make out where the grill leads.
Unfortunately, the grill is much too small for a small animal, much less you.

A Western Passage~
~
~
After all that crawling, you are finally able to stand up straight and stretch
your legs.  You almost fall over on yourself since your legs have forgotten how
to walk straight.  This passage is extremely busy with people coming from
the west and north.  Most people coming from the north look a little freaked,
as if they were just scared senseless.  Others walking in from the west are chatty
and holding some beverages in their hand.  It is going to be pretty hard
going through that shaft with those drinks.

moist enough and hot enough to cause such a tremendous mist to extend down
the ladder.

every wall has a fountain mounted on it.  Each fountain dispenses a different
kind of beverage giving patrons something different to enjoy every time they
come.  The fountain are flowing continuously, draining into several different
holes in the ground.  The owner does not seem to be concerned about waste
apparently.  The owner is so spirited in the selling of beverages, the counter
is in a small wading pool of an unfamiliar liquid and the owner stands right
behind it.  Type 'list' for some beverages to enjoy.

to the south.

Hall of Indecision~

This room seems more like a cage than an actual room with bars covering every
area of the walls except for the passage back to the north and two identical
doors to the east and the south.  A strange looking man stands by the two
doors wearing a pair of shades.  Looking past the bars, there is infinite
darkness.  There really does not seem to be much out there and the only paths
to take are the ones mentioned before.  Two statues stand by the two doors.
One statue of a deity of deception and another of a deity of manipulation.
Neither could bear good news for the paths behind the doors.  You must choose
to either go back or prepare to make a choice that could have severe
consequences.

A Mirrored Hallway~
~
~
A hallway begins here with walls and ceilings that are a complete continuous
piece of reflective glass.  You notice the mirrors seem a bit odd and do not
look like the regular mirrors you are used to.  They appear to have a dark tint
to them.  You notice passer-by's who are just standing in front of a wall and
staring into it intently.  They seem to have been there for a very long time.
It probably would not be wise to disturb them.  Lighting is provided from the
previous room and the light is merely reflected off the surfaces down 
throughout the hallway.

A Mirrored Hallway~

The mirrors seem endless and continue down to this room as well.  You can't
help but stare a bit at your reflection.  In some angles you seem to be
twenty times more attractive than normal and yet in others you appear to be
fifty years older than you are.  What is going on here?  You realize now it
is not hard to get lost in an attractive representation of yourself and lose
track of time altogether.  This is one trap you must not fall into.

The continuous row of mirrors finally ends in this room, giving way to
the plain cold hard steel look that dominates the rest of this area.  Having
the will to pull your gaze from the mirrors you notice a glass door to the
south with a lady sitting behind a desk: a receptionist of some sort. 
Further to the west lies some rubble as if construction was never completed
here.  However, there is a hole just big enough for one person to craw
through.  There would be no point to exploring this area except that there
are lights coming from beyond the rubble.  You look DOWN and see something
moving in the shadows.

It looks as if construction was supposed to occur hear, extending the
hallway even further west.  However, something must have happened to
collapse this end of the tunnel and shielding it from the rest of the area
by a enormous pile of boulders.  This room appears to be forgotten about,
but a singular construction flood light does give this room tons of
lighting.  With all this lighting you can make out a figure hunched over in
the corner.  Picks and other tools lie around this room and a large
wheelbarrow has been knocked on its side.  You look HOLE to make sure your
entrance here isn't blocked as you disturbed some rubble comming thru.

A Lobby~
~

A lobby is here for people to wait for meetings to close and pick up their
respective parties from inside.  A receptionist sits before the doors, 
controlling the flow of traffic and preventing intruders from entering in the
midst of a meeting.  The doors seem to be currently open, indicating no
meeting in session and therefore, anyone is free to just walk in and take a
tour.  Two couches line either side of the room so that waiting is not done
in discomfort.  The receptionist does not seem too happy and you feel its
best not to trust what the receptionist tells you.  Merely observing whether
or not a meeting seems to be in session would probably be the best way to
go.

from the middle.  These other chairs belong to assitants and other audience
members whose interests maybe represented here.  It seems to be currently
unoccupied and the janitorial service has kept it in great condition.  Large
banners are strung across the walls displaying the emblem of the Lies,
Manipulation and Deceit religion.

Stepping in from the chosen door, you find yourself outside and in the middle

path seems to be to the south.  Vines from the trees have grown onto the path
and it will be no easy trek to the south.  The door from which you came has
suddenly disappeared.  Oh well, guess you will have to find another way out of

apparently a park of some sort and perhaps worthy of visiting.  Animals are
scurrying about on the road, running for cover as you approach.  Crows fly
overhead and some occasionally swoop right over you head almost running into
your forehead.

Along a Forest Path~
~
~
The path looks exactly the same as the path you've just come from.  There are
very few differences.  The only striking difference is that there is a dirty
path leading north.  The trees that once stood in the path's place appear to
have been cut down and now only stumps sit in their place.  The south is
completely blocked, but the path extends toward the east.

A Small Park~
~
~
This area barely fits the bill for the title of park.  There are a few benches,
but most of them are falling apart and whats left of them are so littered
with trash, not even a rat would dare sit on it.  The same thing goes for the
paved roads: littered from east to west, north to south with empty popcorn
containers and drink cups.  The road breaks off to the west and you seem to see
a man actually sitting on one of those disgusting benches.

A Sitting Area~
~

Benches are lined around what used to be a park fountain.  The fountain is
now in complete disarray.  It has dried entirely and the sculpture that once
capped the fountain has broken off and now sits at the bottom of the fountain
pool.  Tall dark trees surround the sitting area providing shade, perhaps too
much shade as there is absolutely no sunlight passing through.  There is one
lone visitor of this park and that man sits humming to himself on a bench to
the north.

Corner of the Forest~
~

The path that once existed is no more.  The west has been blocked off by
a wall of bushes and ivies, not to mention the trees that line up behind them.
There is, however, a break in the growth to the south.  It is pitch black in
that direction so you cannot make out what you would expect going down that way.
This area is apparently devoid of animal life, unlike the other side of the
path.

On a Wooden Platform~
~
~
Still pulling out the sharp pricks of the bushes, you find yourself standing
on a vast wooden platform that stretches out in all directions for as far
as you can see.  Unfortunately, you can not see very far at all as a dense
fog has rolled in and surrounded the area limiting visibility greatly.  Out
of the corner of your eye you catch something of tremendous interest and
curiosity.  A large door seems to be floating in thin air.  It is floating
just low enough so that flight is not necessary to enter.  The door is a pale
green color with reptiles of all sorts carved into it.  The break in the
vegetation you came from is still visible and offers an exit if this proves
to be too overwhelming.

Rainbow colors swirl across the sky in the room without a floor.  You are
basically walking on thin air, perhaps a layer of magical power provides the

two enormous glowing gates floating randomly in the sky.  A sign also dances
above the ground.  Looking back to the entrance, it is also just levitating
in the air.

End of the Path~

You have run into the end of the forest path.  Trees and bushes now line the
three remaining directions and there is no possible way to get past them.
It appears maybe they were building a road somewhere, but the work has been
halted for a long time.  The only way to go is back west.

On a Side Path~

Although the path is covered with roots and vines obstructing safe walking,
you have managed to make it this far.  The path has come to and end and before
you stands a small shack that is extremely rundown.  The roof looks as if it
is almost ready to collapse in on itself.  The front door is merely a screen,
but it is too dark inside for you to make anything out.  The trees have gotten
smaller here, probably due to the building and lack of sunlight.  It would
be hard to approach the shack quietly as it is almost impossible to take a
step without crunching some leaves or brushing up against some bramble.

Corners of this shack are covered in cobwebs and large scary spiders crawl
all over these areas.  Snakes have almost found their way into this shack and
are making their way toward the kitchen to find something to eat.  Wicker
furniture stand here, most having large holes in them, making them utterly
useless.  The door is about to fall off its hinges, although it really makes
no difference since the door doesn't shut all the way anyways.  The windows
have been boarded up and the spare nails still sit on the floor, waiting to
pierce someone's unprotected foot.  You try to cover your mouth and nose to
prevent serious dust inhalation.  Some of the wood flooring has also given
way to the natural ground, much like potholes in roads.

A Lava Pit~
~

What paradise is this??  You are *this* close to being burned by the lava
rivers surrounding you.  You stand on a huge piece of rock surrounded by
scorching lava and the only thing connecting these random pieces of rock
are iron boards.  Needless to say the metal conducts the heat very well and
could very well melt the soles of your footwear.  It is apparent now that the
man before the doors had been lying.  Well, there is probably a lesson to be
learned from this: distrust everything, trust nothing!

There is probably a reason this particular rock platform has been connected
to the rest of the island structure.  However, as of this moment there is
absolutely nothing here.  From here you can see most of the lava pit and there
seem to be workers across the rivers.  The extreme heat makes sweat flow
down your head like a waterfall.  It does not help you are wearing such heavy

This rock is much to small to build anything here or have any type of activity
for that matter.  It seems to be just a middle step to get to the other large
rocks in the area.  Looking up and to the east you can make out a figure
sitting high atop a ledge.  You can not really make out much more than that.
There is no relief from this tremendous heat except to shed more and more
of your armor and clothes.  Every once in awhile you seem flames jump from
the lava and onto the rock, charring little by little.

A Slave Camp~
~
~
Immediately after you step onto this rock island, you can hear shouting,
yelling and the cracking of whips.  As you take a look around you realize
these men are hard at work as you saw from afar, but they are being forced.
This is a slave camp!  The poor slaves are mining precious metals and doing
some building as well.  It looks as if they are trying to divert some of the
lava river flow so that island maybe crossed much more easily.  Axes and
picks lie around the area.  Perhaps you should pick one up and help the slaves
finish their work.  A ladder has been extended upwards to a ledge jutting
out from one of the walls.  Another iron bridge connects this island to yet
another large rock to the south.

Another Slave Camp~
~
~
Even after watching the slaves at work, you are still stunned as you see more
slaves working in this area.  The slaves here seem to be using the hot lava
to melt some kind of metal which is then transported to forges set up on this
rock platform.  Blacksmiths sit at the forges making weapons from the material
they receive.  Two large buckets sit in the corner.  One is marked 'Good', and
the other is marked 'Bad'.  In each are a pile of weapons and armor.  A large
wooden box sits on the floor in the middle with a sign reading 'To Temple'.

congregate to enforce the laws of the slave camps en masse.  Various types of

cell that is guarded by four large trolls.  Above the cell reads 'Maximum
Security'.  Benches are also built into this room to allow for guards to take
a break once in awhile.  To the south are security monitors and a security
station encased in glass.

A Slave Prison~
~
~
Surrounding you in almost every directions are prison cells.  These cells are
probably the slaves homes when there is no work to be done.  As you walk
along looking into the cells, the prisoners reach out to you for food and for
help.  Stern guards walk through this area regularly, making sure the prisoners
are behaving themselves.  The slaves are trapped on tiny rocks that surround
this island.  It is really curious how this area became shaped in this
manner.  For the prisoners, it is either die in the lava or sit on the rocks
as they are told.

fly traps that are much larger than the common variety.  Fiery red drapes hang

well in case the four in here can't handle the masses.  There is pretty much
no rules or laws in the maximum security cell.  The guards actually get a 
kick out of seeing bloody fights and even the occasional death.  It is just
one less slave they have to be concerned with.  A cabinet of shackles and
handcuffs are mounted in the backwall.  It is, of course, locked and requires
one of the outside guards to provide a key.  The room is encased in solid
steel, making air ventilation close to nonexistant not to mention the extreme
temperatures due to the heat conductivity.

You stand in front of a brick-like path, however the 'bricks' are made of the
blackest ebony you have ever seen.  Large brick walls extend on either side of
you as far as you can see.  The walls are probably 15 ft tall which is
much too tall for you to see over.  A garden has been planted along the path,
which is dominated by a rare black rose.  Vultures circle over head, making
you think there is something dead or rotting somewhere close by.
 
In the event you did not read the sign, you can escape battle by typing 'flee'.

Looking up, you see that the tower has no noticeable windows or any other
type of entrances.  The tower is constructed of a smooth black metal making
it impossible to scale.  A black mist flows out from the tower entrance, hiding

bone extends up as far as the eye can see.  Several skeletons are hanging
around the room by their arms which have been clamped in shackles.  Dark
black owls with glowing red eyes sit on perches that have been constructed on
the sides of the tower watching your ever move.

in the middle of the room on top of a wooden pedestal.  The sphere is

with every large explosing you hear.  Warning signs have been placed by the
side of the road, warning of bodily harm.

A T-Junction~
~
~
The road ends to the east, but now you are presented with a different choice.
Should you take the path to the north or the path to the south.  At this point,
you see the first signs of vegetation to the north.  Grass seems to have
survived and is growing well in that direction.  A path also leads down a
steep slope.  The tracks make the turn downward.  The east is blocked by barbed
wire.

A Grassy Field~
~
~
This is the greenest grassiest field you have ever seen.  The grass here
seems to almost be alive as it actually looks like it is breathing.  Nothing
could live here as the grass is so thick it would sufficate anything.

A Training Field~
~
~
You have arrived at a large training field where men dressed in military
fatigue are practicing combat moves.  A training commander stands here barking
at the trainees and beating them hard over the heads with weapons everytime
they catch a mistake.  Mean dogs have also been chained up by the fence 
making sure the trainees are not going to escape.  The explosions and 
rumbling do not seem to phase any of the trainees or trainers.  The training
fields extend to the west and the blasts that is causing so much raucus are
coming from the east.

A Training Field~
~
~
More trainees have been lined up in rows in this section of the field.  These
trainees are working on different skills.  While the others were working on
physical combat, these men have been equipped with weapons loaded with real live
bullets.  The swords and blades these men are using are also the dull fake kind.
One blow could knock your head right off.  A large tent sits on the southern
field.

A Blast Field~
~
~
BOOM!  You better run for cover.  Various armaments are being tested in this
field.  Almost everyone here is wearing protective clothing as they set off
some very powerful explosives.  Catapults are also situated here, firing fiery
boulders.  This blast field has been strategically placed, with mountains
protecting three sides.

A Terrorist Dwelling~
~
~
These are the barracks that the trainee's come to after a long day of training.
Of course, there are very few amenities.  The toilet is in the back of the
room with no walls for protection.  There is no shower as there is a hose
right outside.  There are bunk beads lining the room and they are placed as
close to each other as possible to maximize the number of trainees able to
live here.

A Mountain Path~
~
~
You are out of breath as you make it to a level path on the mountainside.  The
path is very narrow so it is necessary to plot your foot extremely carefully
as you cross the mountain face.  Small birds fly around your head at this
altitude and you must duck occasionally to avoid being an obstacle to their
flight.  The flicker of torches is noticeable to the east.

Cave Entrance~
~
~
The mountain has given way to a large cave.  Torches placed along the sides of
the cave provide just enough illumination for you to make out a path.  The
rock walls are extremely thick and provide magnificent protection for the cave
dwellers.  Cave guards stand at the entrance, carefully scrutinizing all that
enter the cave.  The path to the west follows along the mountain face and is
extremely narrow.

A Cave Hideout~
~
~
You stand in a corridor in the northern part of the cave.  Men stand in every
corner of the corridor, watching every movement.  The cave is currently under
renovations.  The renovations seem to be at a standstill probably due to the
plans they are working on.

A Cave Armory~
~
~
You've stepped into a massive storehouse of weapons and armor.  Blades, clubs
and projectiles adorn the walls and sit on the many counters.  Armor hang in
the many closets built into the cavern walls.  An armory chief stands in the
room, assigning armor and weapons and making sure they are eventually 
returned.

A Cave Hideout~
~
~
As you walk along a hallway in this cave hideout, you notice several people
scurrying about, studying and discussiong large stacks of documents.  All
along the walls are maps, diagrams and other writing.  Large animal bones are
sitting on the ground, most likely left over after some meal.  The floor is
covered in thick animal hide, providing a comfortable walking medium.

A Cave Den~
~
~
A stone table has been constructed and placed against of the cave walls.
Plates and pots sit on the table, not cleaned after a large meal.  Large 
boulders serve as seats and there is a small fire going in the middle of the
room surrounded by stones.  Maps and other diagrams have been hung on the walls.
It seems as if these cave dwellers are planning some kind of assault.  The
maps look unfamiliar to you so you couldn't do anything even if you wanted to.

Before the Temple doors~
~
~
The Doors for the Temple of LMD appears to be carved from gold.  The area
appears to be beautiful, but upon further inspection , the vegitation is
fake, the birds are fake, everything is fake, even the painted gold doors to
the temple.  This is very Deceiving indeed.
